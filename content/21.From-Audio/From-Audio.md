### Technical managers With Coding Skills

If you have technical managers with coding skills, it’s a waste of their talent if they’re not coding once they get promoted into a non-coding function like technical architect or business analyst or even manager.

One of the things they should be doing is they should actually be reviewing the tests that are written by the application that they are managing and the fact that they have technical skills and coding skills means they can do it so that is an asset that should be leveraged.

What they should be doing is that for every feature that they request or find a bug, they should be reviewing the tests that represent the fix for that particular feature. And if that’s not possible, that represents a gap in the current test environment, which needs to be addressed. So ideally what should happen is the test should be written in a DSL, which is domain specific language, which should be easy to read and should clearly describe the bug or feature that has been fixed.


### Hiring Games Developers

There’s a lot that the appsec industry can learn from gaming, because they really have spent a lot of time thinking about visualization, how to understand high complex sets of data, things about the maps they create, the kind of ways they map the games so that it is easy for the user to understand and can play it. I think there’s a lot of stuff we can learn from it.

They also have a lot of interesting attacks through the extra games business logic, which is something that we could learn from, too. And more importantly, they also have a lot of great hardware and that is designed for high levels of processing and graphical visualization stuff. So there’s a lot of interesting application security analysis that can be done using the games industry hardware and the software visualization and even concepts.

So I wonder how many of the companies actually hire games developers because as I have said, they are big assets to have and can add quite a lot of value.
