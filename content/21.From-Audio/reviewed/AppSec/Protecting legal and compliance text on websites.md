### Protecting Legal and Compliance Text on Websites.

To do this, you find data that has to be signed off on by lawyers, for example, translations or legal notices on a website. You then assign risk to them based on the QA software development life-cycle maturity.

One example of this is the QA ability to test the integrity of that data. A weak SDL is an SDL in which you have very little source control, have several different developers accessing it, or have loads of javascript being injected on the web application, namely ads.

This results in an inability to guarantee the integrity of the data that exists on the website.

This will highlight all sorts of gaps in a QA SDL work flow and the QA test environment. For example, lead against production and check that the legal text is still there and hasn't been changed.
