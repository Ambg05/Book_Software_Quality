### Hosted Services Source Code

*Need for companies that provide hosted web services to also provide the source code for their apps.*

This article discusses the need for companies providing hosted application solutions to provide the source code of their application.

One reason is to allow the offline hosting of their data as well as the easy backup and restore of their data.

The second reason is to allow the emergence of third party companies and people who also provide those hosting services -- this will make the platform much more robust and effective.

The third and final reason is for security: so people can key review the code and the security assessments, etc.

This is interesting, because essentially it's arguing that Amazon should open their code (again it doesn't need to be open source, it could just be a license not to disclose the code). That being said, I do think that open source has a lot of advantages in terms of being able to contribute and use and take the technology forward.

However, the concept is that for us to be able to trust and use this, and even somehow be able to consume it in multiple different places, we need it to be open and consumable. That's a big step for companies to take.

In some ways, it's already happening. There are actually several examples of companies that provide a service and keep it open source.

I think you already have two variations:

1) You have companies who start as a tool, perhaps hosting a tool or a blog engine, and then eventually the owners of it realize that they should also provide hosting services. The code is already open source and now it just also provides hosting services on top of it.

2) You have code that actually starts as an internal application and then people release the code in some way for the reasons I have already mentioned above.

The other thing that can happen is what happened with Etherpad, which Google purchased and decided to release the source code. This was done in such a way that allowed the technology to live and kept their customers happy.

I think that the way we're looking at it in terms of open sourcing is that how much interesting development where companies actually provide the source code of these hosting apps.
