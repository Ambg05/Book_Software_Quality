### Open Sourcing your Knowledge

The reason you need to open source your knowledge and share what you do, is because you want to have access to those ideas and knowledge in the future. Don't think of open sourcing as a way to brag or as some kind of showmanship (some people are anxious of opening up their ideas or code because they think it isn't good enough).

The reality is that it doesn't matter if others look at your code. What matters is your ability to access those ideas in the future.

Ideas are very fragile and ephemeral.

This means that they only occur in short-lived moments, and if you don't capture them or have a way to revive them, then you will lose it.

It's especially important because ideas are often hyper-linked. Sometimes in order to arrive at the best idea, you need to read about another idea that will help you connect the dots.

The reason you need to publish your data, either on GitHub or another repository that contains your information, is because that is a way for you to return to your ideas in the future.

A lot of the things we do on a day-to-day work basis get locked into whatever company we are working for. You can argue that some things are proprietary and unique to that company, but the majority of the time, what we do isn't actually specific or valuable to that company.

That means that there is no reason that information shouldn't be shared. You should be able to access that information outside of your time at work.

There are some instances where I have to do something at work and then I am able to continue working on it over the weekend or improve it. In a way, that's better for everybody. It also allows other people to contribute to it and share it. If you're lucky enough to have comments, then you start to benefit from the wisdom of crowds.

I am finding these days that a great benchmark for how open and productive my work environment is, is too look at how many daily commits I push to GitHub. The more commits I do (using an open source of creative comments license), the more I am saving my ideas for my future self. The fact that others might benefit from those ideas, is a nice bonus.
