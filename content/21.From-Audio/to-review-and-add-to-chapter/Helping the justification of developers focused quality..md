**Helping the justification of developers focused quality**

Helping architects to ring fence resources for our quality. Every now and then, you find an application manager, an architect or a dev lead that is actually able to ring fence some developers for non function requirements. Things like quality, performance, dev opps, testing e.t.c

It is absolutely application security joins that party and help justification for that architect for why they have those. And the kind of big sic of we are doing security and we want to track and we are improving security of a particular team is achievable.

So, I found that it is very useful in terms of again building relationships if we can help the devs or the dev leads to keep those teams. From your way, you can argue that when we talk about adding to the team and helping them too with tests, we are representing that team which is actually very important.

Which is a team that spends time on non functional requirements on quality stuff. And if a dev team that then ultimately they are going to have a problem. And the idea that if you know you don't have time to those things, it is totally a false.

Because ultimately you don't want to spend extra day but you are going to pay a tenths of X every time which basically is that ultimately within a month or within three months, you already spend more time with extra effort in a particular task.
