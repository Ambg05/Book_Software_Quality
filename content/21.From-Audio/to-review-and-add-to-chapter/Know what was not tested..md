**Know what was not tested**

So, when you are reading application security report, one of the most important questions that you should get answers to are what tests did they do? And especially the tests that they tried and were not successful.

Because usually in that report, you know you see the tests that they did that succeeded. And that is only half or even less than half of the value, what you want to know.

So, if you get a report that doesn't have findings, is that because they couldn't get to the application because they didn't have access to it, because they didn't have coverage or because there was nothing there.

So one of the very important things that you need to see when you see a security report is you want to know what they did. And specially what they tried and what didn't work from a security point of view.

In a way those are actually regression tests, those are actually the confirmation that you don't have a particular vulnerability and also allows you to see how much coverage they have on the application. 

So, very good question is, how many URLs did they do, how many end point forms they submitted, how many tabs of data they actually got into. And gives you the information of basically how good or how bad the tests were and how assured you want to be that that will be good.

So, imagine you had a building and you had somebody to test security of the building, if they came along and said well, the building is okay, we couldn't get in, but then they actually tried to get through and you realize that they only covered twenty or thirty or fifty percent of the ports that are open or that exists, then you know I am not very comfortable with the quality of this test.

So, I think it is very important that you rate the security assessed on how sure you are of the quality tests. Because ultimately what you want to know is are we you know is this telling us how good we are against a very non sophisticated attack developed over time versus somebody who actually will be clever and actually take the time to find vulnerabilities.
