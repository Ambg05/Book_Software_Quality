**Creating DSL for tests**

Why we need DSL for tests. One of the most powerful techniques you can use on the creation of testing is the development SLs which are domain specific languages for the test that is unique in a way. Each website does specific things, each website application does things in different ways.

In order to make the tests very effective, you need to have a specific language or specific domain that represents the language all the way to very high level, cucumber and maybe some really powerful groovy or even coffee script or other languages kind of APIs. I actually like the idea that you use fluent APIs where one thing flows into the other and you are setting up to state for what you want to test.

So, for example if you have to test a web service that does some trading, I should be able to go- new API trading, and then I will go dot create account or log in as user. Go to transactions page, make transactions, get information.

In a way, all those should be chain commands. And then it is only then you actually go and start to write your tests.

So, it is absolutely critical that you have APIs that make your tests more efficient. You also should look at your language and find ways to again have test lines that read much more smoothly.

The bottom line is your tests should be able to be read almost as English. And more importantly, and this is the key, is your tests should be able to be writable by technical managers and technical architect. By everybody, anybody in the organization that is technical like a program should be able to write tests.

Which basically means that your tests should be developed in a way that they are easy to check out, they are easy to start, they are easy to write, they are easy to run, they are easy to share in a way commit and in a way they are easy to create.

Then you have a really positive model for the creation of tests. Which actually means that you need to look at the quality of your tests and understand that ultimately what you are looking is you are looking at the eyes of the quality of your company's code.

Your tests should be some of the most high quality resilient, powerful in a way innovative piece of code that you have in your organization. And you need to allocate this accordingly to your test environment and your test read.
