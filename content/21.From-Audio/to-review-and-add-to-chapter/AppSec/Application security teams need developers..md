**Application security teams need developers**

App sec teams need to have developers under their control, i.e. part of their team, because when we ask dev teams to make changes or implement certain activities like thread model core review, review, static analysis findings, etcetera, we are giving them work.

Additionally, it is very important that when we do that, we come to the table with resources in hand. The idea is that you have developers that are as good as the developers on the other side of the table.

It is essentially you arriving at the table and saying to the application security team, "Hey we need to do this, I am going to throw in a developer X days or a week or a month whatever and you guys need to help".
So in a way this person is going to help you Mr. Developer to do this task.

The other thing that's important is that this gives you the feeling that you can do it regardless of whether the other side will help or not. It gives you the confidence to say, "Hey, I need to do this task. It's part of my agenda, I am doing app sec and I need to do it, so you can help me or not."

And that is an interesting metric you can provide to the business to say, "Hey, you know, Team A was great and they did all this stuff and we didn't have to really work hard. And Team B didn't do that".

In turn, that is good feedback on the quality, resilience, and focus of the teams. That being said, it is absolutely critical that the security teams aren't just this kind of task and negative force that exists on teams and that instead, they add value and they come along and say, "Here it is, let's do this and let's work together."
