**Get 40 days of consulting services to kick start app sec**

If you don't have a big list of security issues or need exploits, basically what you need is to hire a security company and get forty to sixty days from them across the technology spectrum, across the platform. And basically, let them go and review the applications.

And this isn't pen tests, it is an application security review where they sit with the devs, they basically hack anything that moves in the organization and get you the case studies, get you the risks. In a way, get you the tickets so that you can then get the machine going.

So, that is basically a massive security test across the board to really understand what is going on and what is actually happening on the company.

Now, you could also hire these people, you can also hire the security consultants although that should be harder initially. Also you might have a problem that if you are a big enough company you are going to have all sorts of different technologies and you will struggle to hire somebody who understands all those different technologies.

So, it is easier sometimes just to go to a big consulting company and say hey I need forty days of XYZ resources and then they can get them for you. What you could also do is, what you also have to do is hire the individuals of those companies so you don't hire a company, you hire specific individuals of a specific company. Which it means it is easier with a lot of continuity, but also it means that you have a much better talent pool from the consulting company.
