**Next steps of security champions.**

One thing with the security champions, it is important that they are given the time and the focus and the mandate and the information required to do their jobs. The good news is now that you have one, you can measure it so that you can start to see the difference between the multiple teams and the multiple parts of a company who are able to make it work and who are struggling to understand what is going on.

So, key activity of the security champions is to participate in the security activities. Is to write tests, is to know what is going on, is to basically be involved in the security practices of the teams.

And they should be able to spend at least one day a week on those activities which actually is easy for management to accept, much, much harder to actually put it in practice. And one of the things you want to make sure you look from a central point of view is exactly who is doing that and who is actually able to spend the time.

One of the key activities is the maintenance of security tickets of that particular project and the creation of threat models which basically ultimately are better briefs for the application.

The good news of both of these, is this is something that can be measured and tracked from a point of view of all the teams.
