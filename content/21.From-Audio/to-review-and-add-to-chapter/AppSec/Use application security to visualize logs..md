**Use application security to visualize logs**

Once you've got your logs, a typical problem is how to process it and how to visualize them. This can be a problem if you try to address the visualization as a whole. Where there is too much data, there is too much information and you just struggle with the sheer quantity.

One of the ways to do that is if you take for example ELK stack is to actually start with a small question. So you can take an application security question for example vulnerability or something that is happening which is good and you use that to basically create visualizations that are able to answer that question.

So, for example, here am I doing brute force log in attempt, can you detect it? Here am I exploiting a process scripting, can you detect that? So, you run that every hour to generate enough log events, and then you use those requests to make sure that you have enough visibility in your log visualization.

So, for example if you take kibana, what you use with this is you spend the time figuring out how to write the queries and how to actually visualize versus spend the time actually handling a huge amount of data.

So, this is a much more efficient way to figure out how to visualize your logs.
