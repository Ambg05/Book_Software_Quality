**The currency of application security is assurance**

The currency of application security is provability and assurance. What this means, it means that in application security, we should never have ambiguity about our comments.

It should never be, this could be a problem that could be a problem, this could be exploited. It is basically we have to have assurance, we have to have confidence to know what is a problem and what isn't a problem.

And if we don't know something, then we must be sure that we don't know something. So, we have to make sure people understand that if we cannot prove exploit ability, and you have doubts for example that that exploit ability could be possible, then you have to say we don't know that is a problem.

So, in a way, what I have found sometimes especially when it takes static analysis results or tools results sometimes you have this noise, or fog of knowledge, fog of information.

Because what you basically say oh we think it is a problem or like this could be a problem etcetera, and that is just not good enough. We have to have assurance, our currency has to be highly defensible findings. We need to be able to show that every time we speak about something, we have data and we have information in a way about what is happening.

So, when something is potential vulnerability, you have to proof it. And I always find that even if something isn't a problem all the way from the internet, it might be a problem in site. You need to basically follow those lines, you need to follow the lines that say where this is exploitable here, it might not be there, but here it is a problem, and then here is our dependencies.

And that is a much stronger position to be than when you end up having a huge amount of findings or huge amount of stuff that it is easy to dismiss because people go, well, I don't fully understand it or we don't really understand if it is probable or not.

So, even in a worse case scenario where you don't have evidence then your statement of fact is that you don't have evidence. It isn't that it isn't a problem, it is that at the moment we don't have the time to make a decision. Or, we don't have the time to research whether that is problematic or not. And then you make somebody accept the risk of that.
