**Risk accepting threat model**

If you are having trouble getting the dev teams to do threat models with you, or for them to spend the time on those threat models, then the solutions is to make them accept the risk that you haven't done a threat model for this application.

The idea is not to be confrontational, it is to have very pragmatic and focused statement which is we haven't done a threat model for this application. Or this application doesn't have a threat model, or this feature doesn't have a threat model.

Because the idea is that they have to accept that they don't have a threat model. So the logic is not to let that question just hang around, so once you had in a way the strategy is to create a ticket that says we don't have a threat model and we are going to close it by doing it, or if the developers and their management team doesn't want to spend the time, you make them accept the risk that you don't have a threat model.

And that is very objective and that should be very pragmatic which is quite hard to accept for them but that is part of the exercise.
