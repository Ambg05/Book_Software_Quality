### Hosted services source code

*Need for companies that provide hosted web services to also provide the source code for their apps.*

So this is the need for companies that provide hosted solutions of applications need to provide their source code of their applications, and they need to do it for three reasons.

One of them is to allow the offload hosting of their data and the easy backup and the restore of their data.

The second one is to allow the emergence of third party companies and people who also provide those hosting services which is going to make the platform much more robust and much more effective.

And then the third one is for security, so people can key review it and the security assessments etcetera.

And this is basically interesting, this is basically arguing that amazon should open their code, and again it doesn't need to be open source it could just be a license not basically to disclose the code. Although I do think that open source has a lot of advantages in terms of being able to contribute and use and taking the technology forward.

But, the concept is that for us to be able to trust this and to be able to use those and even somehow be able to consume it in multiple different places, we need it to be open, we need it to be in a way that it can be consumable. And that basically is I think a big step that companies need to have.

And in some ways, it is already happening. If you actually look at some of the companies that are doing that, I think there is already a bunch of examples of companies who kind of provide a service and then they open source it.

And I think you already have two variations, you have companies who start as a tool, let's say hosting a tool, a blog engine and then eventually the owners of it realize that they also should provide hosting services, and that is natural, the code starts open source and just be able to provide hosting service on top of it.

The other one is code that actually starts some ways internal applications and then people release the code someway for the reasons I have already mentioned above.

And in fact the other thing that can happen is what happened currently with Etherpad, where after they were bought, basically Google who bought them made a decision of releasing the source code in a way to allow that technology to live, and in a way not to piss their customers.

So I think that way we are looking it in terms of open sourcing is that how much interesting development where companies actually provide the source code of these hosting apps.
