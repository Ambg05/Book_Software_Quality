_Question - how big would the static analysis market be if it actually worked?_

So here is a question, how big would the application security, the static analysis world would be if it actually worked? If we were actually able to look at one app, scan it and get a really in depth analysis of what the app does, what are the security side effects and what needs to be re-mediated in some ways, different information about what needed to be re-mediated?

And in fact one could argue that even if you already had full blown good samples and full blown examples of what should be changed, it still will take a bit of a while to fix.

But someways the question is, how big would that market be? And I think it will be enormous, because ultimately once we can do that, we are actually looking at business intelligence straight into the eye. And we actually have a massive market in front of us, because theoretically every single app, every iphone app, every firefox app, every windows app, every shareware app needs to basically go through one of these reviews.
