**Types of security tests**

How to review a test and figure out if it is a network security assessment or an application security assessment. When you look at a pen. test, you can tell very quickly if it was done by somebody who understands application security, i.e. somebody who can code, a programmer or somebody which is a very good external penetration test.

So what it means is somebody who most likely cannot really code very well, but might have a very good security instinct or security knowledge from a network security.

And you could see, so the first main telling point is if they asked for the source code and they did threat model on the application. If they didn't do that, then you can definitely see that most likely it is going to be a network security assessment.

Then you get to see by the findings, so if the findings tend to be things where you see lots of network scans, ports open, if you see lots of use of something like burp or another proxy, and the kind of findings tend to be more kind of browser based then again that is another very good clue that they actually did a network security test.

A clue from a more strong application security will be how many scripts were actually created during the test and how many tools were created during the test.

So, if you see lots of customization, custom scripts, all sorts of tools that actually allowed them to really test the application, then that more likely is somebody who is doing application security but couldn't have the code so they had to come from the outside.
