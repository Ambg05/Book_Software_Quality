**Helping Developers Justify Their Focus on Quality**

Every now and then you find an application manager, an architect, or a dev lead that is actually able to ringfence some developers for non function requirements -- things like quality, performance, dev opps, testing etc.

It is absolutely necessary for application security to join this notion and help that person justify their focus on the aforementioned requirements. The kind of big sic of we are doing security and we want to track and we are improving security of a particular team is achievable.

I've found that it is very useful in terms of building relationships if we can help the devs or the dev leads to keep those teams. From your persepctive, you can argue that when we talk about adding to the team and helping them with tests, we are representing that team, which is actually very important.

Which is a team that spends time on non functional requirements on quality stuff. And if a dev team that then ultimately they are going to have a problem. And the idea that if you know you don't have time to those things, it is totally a false.

Ultimately, you don't want to spend an extra day, but you are going to pay a tenth of X every time, which means that within 1-3 months, you've already spent more time with extra effort in a particular task.
