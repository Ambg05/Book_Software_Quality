### Power of Exploits

If you own a company that doesn’t have a strong application security team, or a company that has not seen powerful exploits of how they performed in their own environment, which basically means that one of what you need to do security jumping if you’re someone who wants to improve the security is to basically write to the exploits. And you underestimate the power of a good exploit. A good exploit will basically dramatically change people’s perception of what security actually means on the other company.

So it’s absolutely that you do that.

And they have to be professional, they have to look good, they have to look the part, they have to basically, ideally look from a kind of criminal business model point of view, where you actually show data being extracted, sold, being manipulated, remotely controlled systems are always very powerful.

Actually that’s what really will catch people’s imagination.

I think it’s important that you show those exploits from legal to business owners and to developers, because that breaks the whole kind of question of "why should we do security?"

Don’t underestimate the power of an exploit, and if you should find yourself having to justify security, then you’re really at the stage where you need some really good professional exploits that will allow people in the management area to ask the right question.

And that question is, "Can you fix it? Can you solve that security issue from hitting my company, because I don’t want 'that' (the demo you’ve done) to happen.”
