**Docker Research Teams need to be Empowered.**

The teams that for example or Docker at the company and are junk part of the future of the company lies on them. In a lot of cases that is seen as a best effort with some junior developers or some junior people being allocated to that project realize is that containers in that model actually is key for a lot of companies. 

And those things in a way should be in the kind of on a mission from God concept. It should be on a mission to solve the company, they should be empowered, they should be rewarded, they should be high profile, they should have that mandate from the top to break barriers, to try things, to figure how things are.

And in a way to understand that their job is to be disruptive, their job is to prove how it works, so they must be given the best possible outcomes. Most of them must be given budget to do it of course because that is the key.

So, they should be of course trusted, they can't go crazy but they should be trusted to do what it takes in order to solve that particular problem.

Let's say the docker for example is to figure out how to containerize applications, how to actually make the dev environment more productive, how to go all the way to production where you can actually run in docker environment.

Regardless if that gets used in production in a short term, just doing that will solve huge amount of problems, make sure that you understand the dependencies, would create a much better development environment for a lot of companies.
