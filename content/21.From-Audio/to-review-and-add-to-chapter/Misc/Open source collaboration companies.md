**Open source collaboration companies.**

The reason companies need to embrace open source as a development strategy is because internally, when you have multiple teams working together, you need to have common ground ways to collaborate.

And one of the key elements of multi- team collaboration is who controls the components. One of the reasons why there is so much reinventing of the wheel and so much team [inaudible 00:00:34] at work is actually not just because people don't know what is going on or don't want to use somebody else, it is about control and power.

So, if you have a team for example at the company that is developing an authorization model or a particular model, if they are the only ones maintaining that model, if they are the only ones who are able to modify that model, then what you just created was a bottleneck, and a power situation where that particular team now controls the other teams that use it.

And of course this gets political very fast, and all it takes is for one team to be at want to go faster or not the other teams that you have all possible conflict. So, in a way sometimes it is easy and faster and cheaper for a particular team to actually develop something by themselves than to use a shared module.

Now, if that module was open source, then the implication of a fork, the implication of reusing that particular version was much more easy to do. In fact, it will be implied that what you do when you take someone else's code is you fork it and then you commit back the things that should be on the main repository.

And if you don't, then you have what is called the open source tax which is you will have to maintain whatever changes are made to the upstream with the changes that you made in your own fork.

So, ironically, even at company levels especially bigger companies, open source is one of the ways to promote teams collaboration. And this actually is very important when you have companies who buy all sorts of other companies, and then you need to integrate those things. 

And what you end up having is you end up having a situation where for example every one of the products have been acquired has specific modules.They all have got security signature, they all have their own dedication, their own authorization, their own validation, their own way of storing data, etcetera.

And instead of having common libels or common integration among those things, what you then have is every team is fighting for controlling that particular part of the application. Because ultimately, especially again pragmatically it means that if you don't have to maintain some components, you probably need a less head counts. 

So you are going to lose developers, so your team is going to get smaller, so in a way, you are asking teams sometimes to collaborate with the direct idea that they will lose out, they will actually become less involved or less powerful when they collaborate.

Which is of course, it is a guarantee that isn't really going to happen. Not that people will do it on purpose, it is just that they proactively won't integrate. And this is why some companies really struggle when they acquire others and to create products that are working together because there isn't that strong mandate or that strong desire to collaborate because it isn't actually designed in a way to promote collaboration, and open source can give you that.

So, ultimately, companies really need to look at their products and understand what parts need to be open source, what parts really should be propitiatory if they really want to play that game and in a way make the propitiatory part as small as possible because that really should be the magic sauce if you are playing the propitiatory game of course.
