**Open source agenda.**

The fact that somebody open sources or not their code tells a lot about their underlying agenda. In fact, one of the powers of open sourcing code is that it removes from the table a whole number of possible paths, a whole number of possible ways the maker of the code can control what happens in the future.

And that is fundamentally my issue, one of my fundamental issues with products or a code that isn't open sourced is that I don't know what the agenda is. Somebody might turn and say, "here is some code, here is some app please use it", but I don't know what they will do in the future.

And you could see because ultimately, a lot of companies like the idea, reserves the right to say, "oh, I might one day close this and sell this". And what that means, it means that it is going to lock you in to their technology, it is going to lock you in to their product or data. So in a way you just made an investment into a product that ultimately might be out of your control. 

And that is fundamentally the problem, when something isn't open source, you don't know their agenda, you don't know what they want to do with it in the future, you don't know if basically aren't going to be locked in that particular product in the future.

And that is why for me open source is base camp, open sourcing a product, or open sourcing technology is base camp. It is just the beginning of a long journey to create a vibrant community of developers, contributors, users that are basically able to collaborate in the creation of a particular application or software.
