**Annual reports are very selective with the truth**

Most companies' annual reports are lying on application security. Maybe lying is a strong word, they are just being selective with the truth on application security. Which is a problem because it doesn't expose information and it doesn't give the security teams leverage to actually push the right decisions.

Because, there is no visibility, there has to be accountability. I have seen so many annual reports that have risk sections, all sorts of detailed information about the risk they have, but it doesn't talk of application security. Which is crazy because most of their businesses or most of their business runs on top of applications and websites and technology and software.

And that isn't taken into account, which basically means that you have a situation where the company gets away with not investing and not taking technology seriously because ultimately one of the biggest benchmarks they have is the annual report.

Let us be clear, if a product loses one of their key developers and if that person doesn't work at the company any more, that is a big problem. That basically means that the company just lost the ability to understand one of the key parts of its work.

And this isn't like other engineering practices where even if you lose some key individuals there will be very detailed argumentation, there will be very detailed work flows, you can replicate it. That doesn't work like that, most software is black boxes, they are very few people who understand how it works and basically one of those persons leaves, that is a big deal. 

That should go on the annual report, in fact the annual report should contain the names of the key developers who understand the application, who understand how things work. And their loss, if not replaced by somebody else with the same skill or same capabilities is something that should be highlighted because that is a great warning sign for the future to know what is going to happen next.

Because what it means, it means if you lose those individuals, it means that you can't make changes, it means you struggle to understand, it means there is going to be some  team now who is going to be looking at that code going, 'how the hell does this thing work?' and they are going to be very, very cautious in making any changes.

Which basically means that the development will ground to a halt and it also explains why some products seem to be stuck in time and don't change. Because if those products gets to the point, where making any change it is a big deal. Making any change, especially if you don't have a very strong test read, it is a high risk exercise, so those things need to be captured in the annual reports so that the investors can make great decisions. And that is why I am saying most annual reports are very selective with how they explain these things.
