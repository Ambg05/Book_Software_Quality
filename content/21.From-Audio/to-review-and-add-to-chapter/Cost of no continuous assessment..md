**Cost of no continuous assessment**

Lack of continuous integration is very expensive. These days we can totally make the business case that if a team doesn't have continuous deployment, i.e. able to build codes, decodes and ship it to servers in minutes, then we have a problem.

What it means is it means that that team doesn't fit ends to make changes, it will struggle to re-factor. It will spend time chasing ghosts, its developers spend hours and hours of their lives clicking on things, running requests or chasing requests and they are twenty to fifty percent inefficient.

Even worse, they don't build reliable applications. So, these days, we can really make the case to say teams that don't have continuous deployment and teams that have security vulnerabilities, they will have lack of applications,they will have a lot of problems of quality.

So in a way, they don't have a security problem, they have a development. And of course there are teams would continue deployment and still have. The good news is easier to add security there, it is easier to inject than development vul...because problem is that having solved.
