**Application security teams need developers**

App sec teams have to have developers under their control, i.e. part of their team. Because when we ask dev teams to make changes, or to implement certain activities like thread model core review, review, static analysis findings etcetera, we are giving them work.

So, it is very important that when we do that,we arrive at the table with resources. So the idea is that you have these developers which should be as good developers as the ones on the other side of the table high end of dev team.

And it is basically you arriving at the table the application security team arriving at the table and saying, "hey we need to do this, I am going to throw in a developer X days or a week or a month whatever and you guys need to help".
So in a way this person is going to help you Mr. Developer to do this task.

And the other thing that is important is that this gives you the mojo that you can do it regardless if the other side will do it or not. So that gives you a confidence to say hey I need to do this task it is part of my agenda, I am doing app sec so I need to do it. So you can help me or not.

And that is an interesting metric you can provide to the business to say, "hey you know, team A was great and they did all this stuff and we didn't have to really work hard. And team B didn't do that".

And then that is a good feedback on the quality and resilience and the focus of the teams. But it is absolutely critical that the security teams aren't just this kind of task and negative force that exists on teams they add value and they come along and they here it is, let's do this and let's work together.
