**Is Management in a Company asking the right Questions on Application Security?**

One of the problems we have is the fact that most managers don't have application security experience, they have never actually seen an application security program in action, where security acts as an enabler, security makes it go faster, security gives you the resilience and the confidence to invade.

So, they don't know how to ask the right questions. One of the interesting activities that can be done is making them understand the kind of questions they should be asking, the kind of answers they should be getting from their executives. 

So, for example a simple question is when you do pen test, how are you doing penetration testing? How are you doing security assessments? How are you using application security assessments to review the existing practices, find blind spots, maybe check if something is exposed or not or you are just doing an exercise in compliance where you are just ticking a box and actually not asking the good question?

So, it is key that management ask the right questions because only then, the good answers can to be found.

Another variance of this is are the investors also asking the right questions? Are investors giving enough data and good information to actually measure the security and the resilience of a company?

And it is interesting I think most investors will struggle to measure the true ability of a company to control the technology stack. And I think the irony is application security would actually like to do that. Application security would actually give you a way to measure and control what is actually happening at a company.

And, have a good understanding where the company is worth investing or not. So, that might be an interesting angle to tackle this and to get management to really ask the right questions.

Because in fact, annual reports contain sections about risk, about containing risk, about managing risk. The reality is most of that is risk that doesn't include application security which is kind of crazy because these days, the applications control most of the assets of a company.

So, if the company has good data set of security or good management or good risk profiles if they don't control the applications, that is a huge risk that needs to be taken into account.

In fact, most of annual reports are actually wrong when we come to application security. You know just the fact that you have for example major vulnerabilities in your system, major components that are vulnerable or for example encrypting data or no, if we don't have secure applications means that you should present in your annual report. Which they don't of course.
