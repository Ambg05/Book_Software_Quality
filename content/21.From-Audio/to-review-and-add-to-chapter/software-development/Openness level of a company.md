### Openness level of a company

In terms of how open a company is, so if a company all its intellectual property and assets are open, for example open like open source, surely then in terms of level of transparency you are going to start to increase that to the stuff that is produced internally.

So all documents, or internal documents could be made public and eventually all emails, at least let's say a particular email account could be made public. Because we already have twitter messages and all that stuff public and blog posts so that would just be an extension of it.

In some way, that will allow customers to figure out what is going on, gain more visibility to what is happening in that particular company. And in some ways, it probably would allow the company to scale a million places, scale much more comfortably in the open informative way.

_(after all there are already a number of non-authorized parties that have access to the data)_
