**Mandates from management**

In addition to a nice big mandate for security, it is also very important to get from the board, or from the most senior executive responsible for application security a set of very clear mandates which should be specific actions to be done by the team.

So, for example, do threat model for every application understand the attack surface? Have a security champion who would at least one day a week dedicated to application of security. Do security application for developers form security reviews at the end of every sprint? Maintain up to date documentations, which are threat models, right? So, that can be combined with the threat model.

All these are very important and they are basically the lynch pins of your environment, they are the pivots, the things that you basically sit on top and that you actually measure and monitor for your teams that you are responsible for.

So, again when a team says I am not going to do this, that is fine but what they say is that they are breaking a particular mandate. And that is one of your metrics for your security dashboard that you need to give management.
