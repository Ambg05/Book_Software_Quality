### On Lack of automation on the web world

One of the interesting things that is happening with the current if you look at the web world, is that we have a tremendous lack of automation.

It is really sort of amazing how little automation exists on websites and between websites and between the stuff that I do and the materials that I consume.

For example, if I want to move data from one provider to the other, there isn't an easy way to describe how that should happen. If I want to make a bunch of actions on a particular website or a couple of modifications on a particular web page, you know it is almost things like cruise monkey are the only small examples of what needs to happen.

But, I think the problem is that because we don't have web automation, you don't have services providing around these automations. And we don't have basically a healthy promotion and a healthy model that promotes the development of tools, API protocols for enabling that automation of web assets.

We are going a bit on the right direction because by creating the whole web services and AJAX and dynamic sort of content by the semantic web, the separation of coding data that is all good but I think we need a much more focus on this kind of automation of web process.

In fact, I think there is a lot of interesting businesses that you can actually develop and services you can charge by just enabling that and providing that.
