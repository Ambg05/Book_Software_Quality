**Auto updates are really dangerous**

Auto updates are mass applications or machines compromise. The irony is that while we promote auto updates and update into latest version, and the patching of systems automatically as a key security feature, it could also mean a massive single point of failure.

Because if the update system is servers or deployment is compromised, then that is a spectacular way to compromise thousands if not millions of computers and PCs.

So, the auto update is one of those things that actually it just reinforces a problem that we don't particularly control a lot of the apps and the side effects of it. 

Because ideally, what we want is that thing should be under user control, even more importantly, you should only be required to update for example if there are security implication or a security requirement. Where at the moment, we are forced to update the whole thing.

So, even if there is a specific fix, we are forced to upgrade even to the latest version which might have things we don't want, might have functionality we don't want in fact might even increase our tax effects.

Where ideally, we would just like to know exactly what the side effects exactly where the risks exist and why do I need to actually upgrade.
