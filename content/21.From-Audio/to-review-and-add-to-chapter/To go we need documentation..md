**To go we need documentation**

The more you go, the more you need, understand and test. One interesting concept or group thing that can have on agile teams especially the ones that start to shift really fast is the idea that you don't need documentation, you don't need briefs, you don't technical documents, or sometimes you don't need tests but especially you don't need documentation.

That is actually in a way is the opposite. It is literally showering the baby with the bath water. It is because in the past we have been so draconian with some of the documentation that we now create a situation where we don't have that kind of documentation in mind.

And for me the reality is that the faster you want to go, the more control you need to have. The more understanding of the side effects because that is where you get speed, you get speed not by working hard, it is the same thing in fact with sports, and with music. To go faster, you need to go smoother, it has to be simple and easy and the more smooth, the more easy, the more in control you are, the faster you can go.

The fastest guitar players, the fastest drummers, the fastest in the way artists they do it because of technique, they do it for professionalism. They don't it by short cutting and that is the key.

Now, the problem is, our current documentation system is broken, which is why we have this rebellion against it. So the problem isn't that the documentation isn't working, the problem is how we create that documentation, the problem is how we create those diagrams.

And the reality is the diagrams have to come from code, have to come from the actual frameworks that we use. For the idea, documentation is dynamic, this documentation is generated from even the source code, genre web services, is generate from the web scope, the fire ware rules, the actual relationships between what is really happening.

Then, we have up to date documentation, then we understand the...then when there is a code change, a proposed code change, we can actually compare a diagrammic point of view, a threat model point of view what is going to happen and what is the next step. And that is the key thing.

So the key is in order to go fast, we actually need more ending. So the more visibility we have over changes, the better we will be.
