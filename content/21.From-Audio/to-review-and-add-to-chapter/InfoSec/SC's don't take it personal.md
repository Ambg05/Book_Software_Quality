**SC's don't take it personal**

If you are a security champion don't take it personal if teams aren't listening to you. Don't think that you are the problem, that you aren't good enough or that somehow you are failing to communicate.

In most cases, the problem isn't you, the problem is actually the system, the problem is actually the company that isn't structured or architectured in a way that we want the questions that the security champion or security team are asking to be answered and to be prioritized.

So, if you are finding that you are struggling to get traction from a team, the team isn't responding, they fight you, they do everything and they basically treat you as a task, as somebody who is giving them work which they don't want to do, then all you have to do is drop them. Drop the ball, say I tried it, I make that team accept the risk that they aren't doing security, that they are basically responsible for their security, because you cannot help them. 

And that is basically, it isn't you, it isn't the security champion, it is basically the company and the organization. Or even the team which is kind of why it is important to have success stories because you then point to the success stories and say, hey it worked with that team, it worked with that team, it doesn't work with this team, surely I am not the problem.
