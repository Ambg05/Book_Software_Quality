**Sector 12 is safe**

CA had this great Ad [^ca-advert] where this guy was chasing some intruder through some tunnels and was almost about to catch him. And then eventually what happened was the intruder crossed a line into sector 13 and the line basically was there to enter sector 12. And then the security guy stopped running and the security went to the radio and said sector 12 is safe.

So, is it a typical example of a particular application or a particular team will look only at their own area and then care for issues on that area even when they maybe discovered [inaudible 00:00:55] but they actually in a way they almost promoted or encouraged not to care for an organization.

We are doing the opposite, you want companies to realize they are all in bed together and what they really want to collaborate and realize that they have to be open issues in this case with the risk register you open, you know you should be encouraged to open issues on other people's teams.
