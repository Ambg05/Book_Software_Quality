**Using AI For Static Analysis**

We need AI to analyze code, our code complexity is getting to a level that we need to start to use artificial intelligence capabilities to understand it and to really get a grasp into what is going on so that we are able to create secure applications that have no unintended side effects.

And as artificial intelligence becomes much more common place, and Kevin Kelly has some very interesting analysis on that, where he talks about the idea that one of the next major revolutions is where we are going to start to add AI to everything because the cost of AI is going to go so low that you certainly are going to be able to add this intelligence to all sorts of devices, well we should also be doing that to source code analysis and application analysis.

If anything when you analyze an app, you should use everything you have, you should use static, you should use dynamic, you should use interactive, you should use human, you should use in a way now another thing is artificial intelligence. 

Because the data is so vast, and ultimately the data of when you are doing security analysis is a graph so what you have is you have this graph of the relationships, you have the graph of what is happening. So what you are looking is connections, these paths amongst that graph which is a multiple dimensional graph made of what is really going on and what is possible.

So,  artificial intelligence technology that is able to in a way assist the human, assist the person that is going to put context in those things. So I am thinking of quite far away from being able to do that automatically but I think if we can make the job of the human or who is going to review the results much more easy and even possible that is a major step forward.
