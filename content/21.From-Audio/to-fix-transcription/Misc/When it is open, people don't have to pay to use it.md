### When it is open, people don't have to pay to use it

When you make software or information open, you lose the right to control how it is used. An interesting thing that sometimes happens is people release a piece of software or information and they get annoyed when they use it but don't pay for it, as if they are obliged to pay for use.

Part of the game of course is that you don't have to pay to use, which is why it is open and free.

The lack of a good model to pay for software or content that is free is a problem in our current software development environment. The people responsible for creating the open content aren't able to make a living from that work. 

As a society we need to figure out ways to reward, to pay, and to channel funds and capabilities to the people who do specific work and maintain specific pieces of software.
