### Sharing Is A Very Emotional And Dangerous Practice

As someone who likes to share a lot of information, I have a very personal experience of what it feels like when you share data, especially in environments that don't promote, or reward, the sharing of information, whether that is a screen shot, a document, or an idea.

This is a highly inefficient way to work, but many companies do function like this. They don't promote sharing, and so knowledge doesn't get transmitted. 

Usually I tend to have a kind of 'shitometer' scale of a couple of hours a day, and then probably a week, where, if I publish something online, and if within three hours there isn't a massive allergic reaction, then that means that my content can't be that bad. 

If within a day there have been no complaints it means that the other side has lost the moral authority to complain, and after a week of no complaints I then consider the cat to be out of the bag. They can't argue that I shouldn't have shared, because they had enough time to complain, but they didn't.

My problem is, why is sharing even a problem? Ideally, you should be able to share without thinking. When you think about sharing, what ends up happening is you are not rewarded for sharing, you are rewarded for maintaining the status quo.

This can be quite difficult, because by sharing certain information you can jeopardize a friendship or a business relationship. Nobody wants to alienate a company or a business partner.  You may have more important things to worry about in your life or in your work than fighting that particular fight.

I believe that one of the jobs of management is not only to promote sharing, and reward the people that share, but also to share themselves. I always find that when I am in a team the more I share, the more other members share because they think, "Well, if that guy got away with that one, then I am also going to be able to get away with this one", so my sharing gives cover to others.

Sharing can create a positive cycle where sharing creates more sharing. Of course you can also have a negative cycle where nobody shares, or if somebody shares something and gets punished for it, nobody is ever going to share anything again.

Ultimately, what we want is a situation where the sharing of information is promoted, so we can all learn from each other. The lack of agenda is one of the main advantages of the open model. In an open and creative common world, you know things can be shared, and there is already an implicit license to share. 

A license gives you the ability to do something, so you don't have to ask permission and that is the key. That is why collaboration happens a lot more even within a company when you have open licenses.
