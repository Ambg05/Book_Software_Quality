**It Is Not Wrong Because 99 Percent Don't Do it**

It is very important to have confidence in your ideas and to have a fact based approach to life and knowledge. So, sometimes you find you have ideas that the majority or others don't like or accept or believe.

And the way I look at it is if as long as you aren't doing any damage to others or it is damaging it is okay for you to have those ideas. In fact there are a lot of people that died and suffered in the past for you to be able to have the freedom to have those ideas so you might as well honor them and really go with it.

A good example for me is a couple of number of years a good friend of mine recommended a book called, "Born to Run" and he was walking barefoot, I read it, I really liked it, I looked at the science behind it and I realized it was all sound, in fact I tried it and I liked it.

So basically I started walking barefoot and now it has been four years I have been walking barefoot as much as I can on the road, on airports, through the city, on restaurants and it is great. Initially it was definitely a social element that you had to go through it but there was this idea that this is healthy, this is good, I like it, why shouldn't I be able to do it?

And it is the same approach in code, if you have ideas or in business and you believe on those ideas you should be able to pursue it and you should continue knowing that basically most people will not understand where you are coming from. And in a way, sometimes you have the curse of knowledge where you have made a whole bunch of paradigm shifts that others haven't. So you have the situation where you basically are thinking in a different plane which is in a way where magic occurs and that is where all interesting things happen. 

So be confident with your ideas and just remember that it is a long game, there is the concept base, there is a lot of people that have the seven year work to have an overnight success or twenty years' work. Sometimes you need to work on something for ten, twenty, thirty years until it actually becomes something that is valuable and usable by more people. But then that is life.
