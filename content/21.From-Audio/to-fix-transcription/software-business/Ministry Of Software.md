**Ministry Of Software**

Writing software as a key competency of a country. 

So, countries need to take software seriously, they need to understand that software is law and software is basically controlling the society.

So, they have to view it as a core competency, they have to create standards, they have to create regulation, they have to create environment to promote the creation of good software. The same way that we are doing in infrastructure we want to make sure that we have good roads and good environments for society.

So, this means that it is important for companies and countries to take software seriously and to view it as something that they have to do at the core level not something that can be just outsourced and have no visibility into what is going on.

At the moment this is something that very few companies and very few countries have realized or have mapped as something they have to do strategically. For example, where is the Ministry of Code? Where is the Ministry of Software Development? Where is the Ministry of Software Testing? All those things are absolutely key.

Unfortunately, we have a very bad track record of governments creating good regulation and good environment for this. Which basically means that either we change how some of these governments work or we focus on basically organizations, open organizations that are basically staffed by independent and passionate people who care about solving the problem.

In fact in America there have been some interesting examples of these divisions that are creating software that are breaking all sorts of barriers and are implementing all sorts of great solutions by just applying in a way the Silicon Valley developed quick sort of work flow and actually being very, very efficient.

But the key is that this needs to be done from a central point of view, it needs to be done from a bigger lens, a particular company or a particular environment. Because I don't think it can be done in an environment where profit is single overarching objective. 

And that is one of the problems that we have with companies because they are focused in a way in maximizing the profits or locking in even sometimes some Non-Profit Organizations they have a particular agenda they want to lock in to their software, lock in to something.

Which basically means that we need to have independent agencies who are able to actually push this forward and create really good standards for how to actually develop and secure software.

This is something that The European Union could push but again the track record of creating this kind of thing and this kind of relations isn't very good. That doesn't mean that there is no way we can do it but we have to be careful not to throw the baby with the bath water and say there is no regulation needed because we actually need some standards, we actually need some ways to control the software that we are actually writing.
