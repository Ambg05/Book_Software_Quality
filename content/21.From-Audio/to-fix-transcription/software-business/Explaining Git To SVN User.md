**Explaining Git To SVN User**

It is actually really good analogy for all sorts of things because it shows what happens when two paradigms go face to face or head to head and one user is already productive in one of that. So, in this case, you take an SVN user which is quite good at using SVN and is quite comfortable with that, uses quite well, and then is having a conversation with a git user.

The git user will explain the things you can do with git, you can merge, you can do pull request, you can have a bit of a distributed thing, and usually what happens is the SVN user will say, "well I can do all of that. I can do all of those things in SVN so I don't need Git".

So the interesting thing is what is really powerful about git is not necessarily the technology which of course is quite amazing, but it is the work flows that it allows. So, if you try to go an SVN user, and you say, "look for every issue what I am going to do is I am going to create a branch and I am going to make some commits on that branch, the smaller the commits the better. Then someone is going to collaborate, is going to send me a pull request to my branch, and then I am going to check it out, add some more tests and eventually I am going to merge it into my main branch",  the SVN guy is going to go, "wow, you lost me at the first branch".  

You don't create a branch like that in SVN and that is the thing, because branches in git are technically seconds and they are very cheap and you can do all sorts of stuff with it, suddenly you have different work flows.

The other major work flow that you have which you see in git which you don't see in SVN is a much cleaner commit. Is the whole pull request concept that you make the person submitting the commit actually clean it up, actually make it easy to read. And that again is a massive paradigm shift.

The interesting thing is that until you experience it, it is hard to visualize, until you experience the power of having again all the commits locally, you have a full back up and a full database of all the commits in your local machine, how that totally changes what happens, how that totally changes the fact that for example you aren't going to make git a dumping ground of stuff which is what happens in SVN, you tend to have this massive thing where every freaking document is in there, and then you have this massive repos which are kind of just crazy.

And what is interesting is now that this is exactly a conversation that happens when you try to explain the difference between docker and a virtual machine. People are docker and VMware or Docker and Vagrant because people go, "Well but I could still create those VMs like I could still create the same thing". But of course it is not the same because the size and the speed of docker is just off the chart compared to what you get in the VM.

So it is interesting when you have these two worlds where until somebody experiences it is very hard to actually fully understand the benefits of the technology. 

What happens is also you get the curse of knowledge which is once you've done that jump, it is very hard for you to understand what it felt like in the past. So suddenly those paradigms are just easy because you just get it and you evolve. So sometimes it is interesting curse because you can't really explain very well what is happening because now that is just how you think.
