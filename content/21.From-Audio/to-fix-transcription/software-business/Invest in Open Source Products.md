**Invest In Open Source Products**

Companies need to invest in the open source modules or products that they use. The way companies buy open source, or buy products that are open source is they hire somebody whose dedicated job is to maintain and customize and contribute to that process.

That means that companies need to have core contributors to open source projects that are basically able to implement the features, push bug fixes, use the product, in a way be active users of that particular open source community.

And that is very important because it also sends a very great message that open source isn't free because it isn't every software has a cost. And basically by investing and putting people to work in open source projects the company is taking it seriously and it has somebody who is accountable for that particular application.
