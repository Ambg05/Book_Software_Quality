**Business Model For Security Start-ups**

Key problem with security start-ups is that they currently have the proprietary model, they need to lock their technology. Ironically a lot of those guys who are doing that today, they actually come from a very strong open source background and they would love to open it but they can't because now they can't finance it and companies today don't have a model to actually pay them. 

And in a way most companies are happy to consume stuff but they don't have a way to actually reward that consumption so they kind of view it as free. Which is actually wrong because there is no such thing as free software, free things.

So, one we should model will be for the clients, i.e. the companies who have the problem, who need to be secure who actually need the security technology to go to another level for them to start viewing these companies as investments, as research.

And in a way part of idea will be, "hey you know I will buy a hundred grand of your product or your service and the only catch is that everything you do has to be open, everything you do has to be released under open licenses".

What it means, it means that you have an economic model that you award that kind of behavior.
