**Are You Creating Git or Git Hub**

When talking about potential business models for teams that develop technologies that have a sort of a puzzle or a fundamental initial step of analysis that then produce some results, there is always the question about what is the business model, how that works.

My view is that for that kind of applications, you need the core technology to be open source because you need scale, you need a very large amount of users to actually use it, to push it hard, customize it, and create all sorts of modules etcetera.

And you see that with static analysis where we have a couple of proprietary closed engines and basically an industry that has really evolved in the last five to ten years because you don't have enough scale, you don't have enough people using it, enough people who know how to use it, enough people who rally roots for it, so it becomes a horse show.

So, a good way to think about this is when you look at open sourcing is you want to be git or git hub. So, git is basically open technology, where git hub is actually in a way closed technology because they haven't open sourced the UI and the work flows built on top of open technology.

So what you have is you have this technology which is git which everybody can use, that gets involved that gets all the benefits of open source. And in a way what git hub is providing is the service of using that technology; is the community, is the ease of use, is all the reliability that you want in a way all the security, all the security features, all the repos, all that jazz that makes a massive difference. Those are real problems faced by real users.
