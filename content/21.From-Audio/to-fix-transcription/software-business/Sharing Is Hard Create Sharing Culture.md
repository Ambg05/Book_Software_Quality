**Sharing Is Hard Create Sharing Culture**

Sharing is really hard, one of the powers of adopting an open source culture in my argument is that Portugal and countries should basically adopt open source as a culture, adopt creative comments as basically core again strategic value is that it promotes sharing, it promotes idea sets that the agenda is that you default to sharing, you default to collaborate. When you don't share, it actually means that you aren't doing good things.

So that is something that should be permeate because you can argue that the point of government is to share information, the point of government is to share knowledge, promote stuff for the greater good of society.

So one of the culture problem we have in Portugal is the culture of sharing, is the culture of I am not going to give somebody else this information because I have it and I can make a little bit of profit, I can benefit a little bit so I am going to hide a little bit. Even if somebody doesn't want to do this, if you don't have a community where the culture is for sharing that is very hard.

So, I think that you need to change the north and the north should be collaborating, sharing knowledge, in a way it is the anti patent concept is going to be against patents. In fact Portugal countries can be investing and creating in a way game in the patent system. But by obtaining patents and then releasing those patents in an open way to promote that sharing of information and not the lock of ideas.

And this is something again that can be done at government level or can be done at companies, companies can decide you know what we are going to play like this. I am going to be playing on coming up with a solution and just doing it regardless if others do it and eventually you go along the way. And, if you want to take the lead, if you want to see who is taking the lead, look at Tesla.

Tesla Elon Musk is an amazing individual because when you reach a point of success, a point of top peak research instead of locking it like what other companies have done, he open sourced, he is open sourcing a huge amount of patents from the space exploration and from the car research and the battery research because in a way it is a way to level everybody, improve the level of what everybody else is doing. And of course then other companies follow suit because suddenly you look really bad if you don't do it and you can't even hire the talent if you don't do it.

So if you can create this amazing ecosystem where people are sharing, people are collaborating you will see the amount of people that work, you see the amount of productivity just goes to the roof. And that is something that should be done again at strategic level.
