**Does outsourced code have more secure vulnerabilities than code developed in house?**

That is actually a very interesting question because usually, outsourced code tends to have less quality, or tends to be more focused on the brief that was particularly asked. Which basically means that every non functional requirement tends to be thrown out of the window.

I am not saying as a principle all outsourced code is bad, but in my experience, most of the code that I have seen that has been outsourced the level of quality tends to be much lower than the people in-house.

And that is fundamentally also because the people that program in these outsourcing companies, they don't care, they are paid to deliver particular things, if you ask them to deliver A, B, C, they will deliver A, B, C whether A, B, C, is wrong or right, whatever as long as the success criteria is passed, then they achieve their goal.

What happens with internal developers is they tend to have a much bigger duty of care, also because they are the ones who are going to maintain the thing. So, they have a much firm understanding that they need to be able to care with it or else they are the ones that are going to be paying the finical debt for a long period of time.

So, it is actually interesting to get more data on this but this is one of those where I will be pretty sure that if you look at the mappings of code developed externally and code developed internally, the number of bugs, especially the number of security issues is much greater from the code that is outsourced.

The other problem is that a person who decides to outsource the code is long gone usually after a while. So that means that they don't have to deal with the side effects and the consequences of that decision.

So, usually in outsourcing, your short term benefit is far limited by your medium term damage or cost.
