**How Secure is Portugal?**

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructure?

So, Portugal today is a very digital country, most companies these days are basically software companies. If you look at how they operate, all of them are in software and is controlled by software.

So, the question is, how secure are them? How safe are them? So, secure is basically their abilities to sustain attack, their ability to detect and react on possible attack on their digital infrastructure.

Safe is how likely in a way and what is the probability that will happen in the short term. So, in a way they are very different concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is highly insecure, but at the moment quite safe.

The reason it is safe is because there is not enough attackers, because there is not enough people attacking the current insecurities of the system. And most likely it will stay like that for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, what happens when the criminals improve their business models and start to really go after the Portuguese assets.

And I would argue that Portugal has already been a victim of certain kinds of financial manipulation because if you look at what happens with the financial crisis, half of it or a junk of it was actually artificially created by the markets which pushed the Portuguese economy really hard and in fact made a lot of money by betting that Portugal was going to struggle a bit and will struggle in the financial markets.

If you look at Portugal companies, and you look at the size of the application security industry in Portugal, you see that is small. You see that there is very little companies with bad bounties, there is very little companies with public application security teams, the market for security companies is very small, you have a couple interesting Pen testing companies, anything that dramatic, you don't see a lot of activity in that space.

It basically means that you don't have those because that is a direct consequence when you have been attacked, you create a lot of teams, you hire. If anything, Portugal is exporting security experts, I know a lot of great Portuguese app sec, info sec specialists in the UK. 

In fact the problem is we aren't being dragged to Portugal, at the moment it is to UK and countries that are more evolved in application security that are recruiting whereas what you should be seeing is Portugal going out there and hiring talent from other places.

So, the reality is the Portuguese industry on application security isn't very mature. So the question is, does Portugal want to be like probably the rest of Europe and be caught in the cross fire or it actually wants to be proactive and actually create industry which actually could be very powerful, very effective and very profitable for Portugal and help to secure Europe and help maybe the world?
