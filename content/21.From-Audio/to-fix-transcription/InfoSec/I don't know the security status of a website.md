**I don't know the security status of a website**

Lack of data in making decisions about application security. Yesterday, I was looking at this very interesting company to use for my kids. And it is a company that provides credit card payments for any cards for the kids which is a very interesting service that allows them to get a card which will control the budget, e.t.c. And there is even a way to invest in the company which is quite interesting like Kick starter for investment. 

The problem I have is that I am a knowledgeable person, and I am not able to make a good security decision. I am not able to make an understanding whether that is okay or not for my kids. 

Everything I take there is at face value, they have no requirements to actually publish any real information about their product. So, it is all marketing, so if they have credit capability, if there is massive issues within there, if my kids data is going to be verified and protected, I have no objective way to measure that.

And I am a knowledgeable user, I am able to process security information, I am able to process highly technical information about the application security of the particular web service. And, the problem is, I don't have that data, and I don't have access to that data.

So what it means, it means that my friends recommended that service to me, they are even worse because not only they don't know that information, they aren't even able to assess that information and they just have to go it by the website.

And what this means, it means that if there are three or four competing service at this moment in time, they will not be able to compete on the security of their product. So what you have is you have a kind of oh, let's do security because it could be a problem or we could be embarrassed or it could be an issue in the future. But that just not good enough that is like saying, "oh, let's not pollute because somebody might come over and take a photo of it, or somebody might catch us" And that isn't good enough. 

And one of the mapping that these days security issues are directly correlated to quality issues. Then what you have is a situation where in the application, security could be used to really gain understanding of what is going on in the in the hood and whether that will be a good company for someone to invest, and a good company to actually use as a user.

And of course this would scale because if I found problems or if data was open I could publish my analysis and others could consume so you have a much more peer reviewed work flow for companies. 

In fact it is going back to the first point, at the moment, I am not able to understand the level of a security of a company because they don't have to publish it. And that is probably one of the things that should change, and will change the market if it happens.
