### Security Management Dashboards

It is critical that you create a whole set of management dashboards that represent the mapping of security metrics you are tracking. When you track the management requirements, the BSM mappings, and the current risks that are being accepted or acted on, these factors all have to create very strong dashboards, and they have to be given to all the players.

The idea is for a sequence of dashboards that starts with the developer, maps the things that he is responsible for, then goes to his technical architect, then on to the business owner, the product owner, and all the way to the CTO and the CSO.

Each party makes it clear which areas they are responsible for, what risks they find, and the current status of application security for those particular applications.

This approach creates increased visibility, and it allows you to identify action items. In a way it will lead your security activities because you will want to act on the 'red' areas. You want to act on the areas that need work and that show gaps in your current environment.
