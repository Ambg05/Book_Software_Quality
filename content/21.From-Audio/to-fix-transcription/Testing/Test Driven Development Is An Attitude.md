### Test Driven Development Is An Attitude

Once a developer is used to programming in an environment where the unit tests execute in real time, and you see code coverage in real time in the IDE there is really no way back because the productivity gains are so great that if that developer is faced with coding in any other environment, his brain will actually complain for not having those techniques.

And this is an attitude because it is not really a technology, it is more an approach. And it is also understanding that tests need to run fast, tests need to be executed as soon as you lift your hands because that means you don't shift context.

And changing context is very expensive for a developer because it means that you lose your concentration, you lose your models and ultimately everything takes way longer, which is very unproductive.

The same thing with real time code coverage because once you start to have it, you start to realize that it is an amazing tool to understand what is going on, where the bugs are occurring, where the issue actually is, what is the code paths. So in a way you debug with the code coverage. But that is something that is only possible when also you see it in real time.

And, one of the major advantage of the work flow where the tests runs in real time and the tests run only for the code that has been changed, is that you can make a change in the middle of the application and you immediately see which tests actually failed, you immediately see which paths cause the problem, and that is given to you by the test that fail but also by the code coverage.

And in a way it is like programming with repl and it is very, very powerful.
