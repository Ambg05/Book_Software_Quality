**You have assurance when you have tests**

They way to have assurance in application security is to have tests. You need to be able to prove every single statement you do. You need to have tests, have proof if something is exploitable from the outside world, if a particular thing is a problem, if a particular method is a problem, if a particular function is an issue, something exists you need to have tests.

Even if the test is as sort of raw as just making a text comparison on a file, rank X search a grip in tensing a network request, a C URL request, all those things are just proof that something exists.

And that is what you need, you need to have tests, assurance comes from tests and your tests need to then follow up the fix across the organization.
