**Test Technology Can Be More Interesting**

I have seen many cases where some of the most interesting and advanced and powerful techniques in application happens in the test. And the reason is because with tests you have to figure all sorts of interesting and creative ways to actually be able to access the application, access the application in a particular state that will make sense for that particular test or that particular question to be answered.

Which is why from a technology point of view you tend to have some really, really interesting problems to solve, you have some really interesting challenges that need to be addressed in order to be able to test those things. 

That is why I like to tell developers that you sometimes think that going to a test world or to become a tester is actually going down on your career or you are moving down, but it actually should be the other way round. You actually can do a lot more interesting stuff, you can do a lot more interesting research and even solutions if you are working in the test environment.

Of course you know in development you will do both either way but sometimes it is nice to just be able to focus on how can I be able to spend time or how can I make this tested.

One of the things I constantly try to pass is that although you have limitations on the technology that you use on your application and that will be locked into a particular version for a while, you have no limitation on the technology and the capabilities of your test environment. 

So there is no reason why your test environment, it is not running best in class, latest ideas, latest developments, latest stuff that you can have. Which is kind of why for example I like to use Node.js for anything to do with web traffic and network traffic because it is just easier, it is native, it is faster, it scales like there is no tomorrow and especially with tools like Wallaby you are just coding at crazy speed.
