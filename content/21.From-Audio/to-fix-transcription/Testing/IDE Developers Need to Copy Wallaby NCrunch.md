**IDE Developers Need To Copy Wallaby And N Crunch**

At the moment there are two tools that for me represent the work flow that you need to have when you program. One is wallaby that actually is for java script which now runs in a huge amount of IDEs which is great, and the other one is N crunch which runs in visual studio for dot net.

What these two tools give you is real time unit test execution and real time code code coverage which these days I view that is as important as IntelliSense code and code compilation on an IDE. What I don't understand is why the IDEs haven't copied this functionality because that is a fundamental piece of making developers better.

And I think IDEs should have the responsibility to make developers better, make them easier, make things smoother, make them write more tests, make them create applications that are really solid because that is a great advantage of using a particular IDE because it is making me as the developer more productive.

So what I would really like to see is IDEs like visual studio, IntelliSense, Intelli J, Family, Eclipse, Autum, all the big ideas supporting that. Natively supporting the ability to execute unit test in real time basically when you lift your hands and seeing code coverage also in real time.

Remember that executing test is tricky because you have to detect which test has been modified with the code changes. So you can't just run all the tests all the time because it is too expensive. So, it isn't actually the exercise but the way I look at it you will make a massive difference in the quality of the code created by those IDEs.

I also view that languages should have the responsibility to support this. So it should be part of the language spec these days that they can debug which is everybody expects that but also real time test execution and real time code coverage.

So when the new language comes along, and there is always popping up, let's say let's take groovy, java, Go, closure, all sorts of these languages that are popping up, we need to be able to run them in this environment because that is how you code very, very efficiently and that is how you create test room environments that create 100%, 95% code coverage without even trying because you code through your tests. So, you basically programming in this fluent and very efficient, and synogetic way.
