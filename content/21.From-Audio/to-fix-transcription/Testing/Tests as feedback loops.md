**Tests as feedback loops**

Tests are your feedback loop, the power of tests in an organization at all levels is that it provides a feedback loop on what is going on. It provides a way to measure, to understand the side effects of what is being done. And that is why they are so important.

If you don't have a good test environment, you don't have a focus on tests, basically means that most of the time what you are doing is [inaudible 00:00:33] most of the time you don't understand the side effect of what you are doing and basically what is going on, on your application.

And eventually you are paying the price, eventually you pay the price for those compound problems because a change today is going to cost a lot. So, you need to view tests as feedback loops, and the better the feedback loops, the more you can measure, the more you can actually make things solid.

That is basically really why tests are so important in an organization.
