**Who Is Paying For App Sec**

Who is paying for secure software and secure coding standards?

So, one of the interesting questions when we talked about the need for open sourcing security coding technology and security coding centers and all that we need to actually build threat secure code is; who is paying for it?

Unfortunately in the past we tried to do the pure commercial model and I don't think that has been very successful. It means that we have a lot of good stuff going on in individual companies, there isn't a lot of collaboration, there isn't a lot of actually sharing of technology. Which is something that needs to be done centrally, in a way it needs to be done from a central organization that cares for example about the problem at the biggest count.

So, how do we pay for all this? Well looking at the best place to pay for this is for companies and governments to chip in into individual organizations, or independent organizations. Who then are able to hire very talented individuals, who are then able to actually work on the solutions and push solutions in open way where their whole agenda is to solve the problem.

That is actually one of the things I feel that happens to me once I start working for the client i.e. the company who actually have to solve the problem where you totally change the way you think about problems. 

You go from being a vendor where you try to sell your services or ultimately part of your objective either basically or even just accessibly is to lock in the customer to your services and to what you do or to sell more stuff like that. Where suddenly the focus becomes actually how to solve the problem, or how to make things work in our world.

And this means that what you need is to have all these organizations chipping in into that common organization that will actually be the one that drives it forward.

So, the idea here is collaborative comments that is the economic model that we have. The book Zero Marginal Cost Society talks to this in great extent and is actually a great financial indicator model for how this should work.

Should governments be driving this? Yes. Do governments have any clue to drive this? Most of them no. So, I think the short term solution is for companies to actually drive this. 

Companies will need to solve the problem, companies we are basically seeing App Sec going their way and they are totally screwed because they cannot recruit enough people and they can't actually scale up. And as the attackers become more and more efficient, then you have a problem of who is actually going to implement and solve the problems.
