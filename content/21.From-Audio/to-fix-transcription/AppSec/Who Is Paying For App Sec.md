**Who is Paying for AppSec?**

Who is paying for secure software and secure coding standards?

One of the interesting questions that arose when we talked about the need for open-source security coding technology, security coding centers, and everything we need to build threat secure code is: Who pays for it?

Unfortunately, in the past we tried to follow a purely commercial model, and I don't think that has been very successful. It means that while individual companies are doing a lot of good work, there isn't a lot of collaboration, and there isn't a lot of sharing of technology. This is something that needs to be done centrally, from a central organization that cares about the problem at the highest level.

But, how would we pay for all this? Well, the best way is for companies and governments to contribute to an independent organization. The organization can then hire very talented individuals, who can work on solutions and push solutions in an open way because their only agenda is problem solving. 

That is something I've noticed happening to me once I start working for a client--i.e. a company who has a real problem to solve. Once I start working for them, solving their problem becomes my major focus, instead of thinking commercially and trying to sell my services to the customer.

So, the idea here is collaborative, and we have an economic model for this. The book Zero Marginal Cost Society talks about this in detail and provides a financial indicator model for how this should work.

Should governments be driving this initiative? Yes. Do governments have any clue how to drive this initiative? Most of them don't, so in the short term I think the solution is for companies to take the lead. 

Companies need to solve the problem of paying for collaborative AppSec because within companies, AppSec is experiencing difficulties recruiting enough people, and scaling up. And as attackers become more and more efficient, the problem of who is actually going to implement and solve these issues becomes more important.
