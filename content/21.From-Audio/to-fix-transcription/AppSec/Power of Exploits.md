**The Power of Exploits**

If you own a company that doesn’t have a strong AppSec team, or a company that has not seen powerful exploits performed in their own environment, this means that, if you want to improve security in your company, you need to write to the exploits.  Never underestimate the power of a good exploit. A good exploit will dramatically change people’s perception of what security actually means to their company.

So it’s imperative that you write to the exploits. But, when you do, they have to be professional, and they have to look the part. Ideally, they should look like a criminal business model; you should be able to show data being extracted, sold, and manipulated. These  remotely controlled systems are always very powerful, and demonstrating them will really will catch people’s imaginations.

I think it’s important that you show those exploits from legal to business owners and to developers, because that answers the whole question of "Why should we do security?"

If you should find yourself having to justify security, then you’re at a stage where you need some really good professional exploits that will allow people in management to ask the right question.

And that question is, "Can you fix it? Can you solve that security issue from hitting my company? Because I don’t want 'that' (the demo you’ve just done) to happen.”
