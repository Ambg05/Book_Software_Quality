**Information Security and Uses.**

Information security tends to have a really bad attitude towards users, where they get blamed for doing insecure stuff. It is like health and safety complain that people are doing things, so it puts them into danger.

The fundamental logic is that security is there to empower users. In fact security is there to allow the users to go faster which is the analogy with brakes in cars. So, if a user for example or developers which are also IT users run their desktops with admin privileges fundamentally that is an apps information security problem.

Not from the point of view that the user shouldn't be doing that, it is that the user should be given alternatives to do what they need to do in a day job in order to be productive without needing admin rights. Or, they are given solutions to do the stuff that they need to do without being given admin rights.

These days, with virtualization it starts to be more and more easy and faster to for example somebody wants to do something that requires specific admin privileges or install some stuff, you can give them a VM, you can give them a machine they can remotely desktop into it that is totally isolated, much more protected, and also disposable and dis-countable. And this same person has access to assets that the normal user gets exposed.

So the idea would be if that thing gets compromised, which the user then does really need admin privileges then it is self contained. Of course it isn't held in our current IT infrastructure and development software or we have got admin privileges and a lot of them require and a lot of them require extra privileges but that doesn't mean that we implement solutions to isolate that.

So, the bottom line is that the info sec tends to really sometime have a bad attitude about the users and also the same thing sometimes happens in app sec, the sec guys having the same issue with the program as in developers where codes them, strikes off the code they are writing and basically really in a way it is offensive by what developers are producing.

Where in my book, developers tend to be very clever, they double their knowledge, both of the times the problems they do isn't really with them but is with the eco system and the environment that they are coding on.
