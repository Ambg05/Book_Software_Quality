**Do you have an application security team?**

Let's be clear. If you don't have a team of highly skilled professionals who understand application security, who can program better than most of your developers, and who will be totally hireable by your team, then you don't have the best possible team.  What you want is an application security team that is keen to write security code, find vulnerabilities, commit security assessments, review threat models, and work with security champions across the company. 

An information security team is also very important to perform this type of work, but if you don't have an application security team you simply don't know if your applications are secure or not.
