**Capture the success stories of your threat models **

The key element of doing threat modeling is that it can highlight all sorts of interesting issues and blind spots in particular architecture. And one of my favorite comments, a very powerful comment is when the people involved, the developers and the architects do a threat model and they realize something that they hadn't noticed before.

Sometimes the developer who says, "oh, I never realized that that is how it worked!", or an architect who said, "well, this is the designer, this is the design", and the dev goes and says, "well, but that didn't work, so we did it like this".

And what you are doing is, you are actually mapping reality. You are basically having a much better understanding of what reality actually means on the company. And basically what you are doing is you are mapping truth, threat model becomes a single source of truth of the company.

And what is very important is to capture those successes, and to be able to advertise and promote and say this is one of the reasons why you want to do threat model, is because you want to understand what is going on, you want to make sure that everybody is in the same page in terms of development and QA and testing and everything.
