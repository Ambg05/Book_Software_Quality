**Why SAST rules need to be customized**

The reason it is so important to customize static analysis engines is because we need to teach the tools where resources are: where the assets are, what matters, and what we really want to know.

So, by customizing rules, it allows the people who understand the application to indicate the areas of concern. This eventually gives you  highly defensible, highly robust, results that are actionable when they occur.

By not allowing customization, by making customization hard, or by treating it like a second class citizen, the tools will promote the idea that a one-button click is all that is needed to do the job, and this is not true.

This really shortchanges the quality and the value of those engines' capabilities.
