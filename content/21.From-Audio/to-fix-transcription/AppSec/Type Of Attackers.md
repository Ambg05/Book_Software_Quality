**Type Of Attackers**

There are a number of different types of attackers that will hit the organization. In a way the key difference is whether theirs is opportunistic attacks or focused attacks on you. 

So opportunistic will basically be you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time [internet speaking] and you just happen to use a particular framework or technology or be close to something or even just have some personal relationship with one of the attackers.

And focus is when you actually are targeted by particular attackers again because they are going after your business or your type of business e.t.c.

In a way the next big element is whether the attackers have a criminal business model or not. Yes there is some very sophisticated, state sponsored and activist attackers but the reality is the big damage is caused by criminals, kids and script kiddies less experienced attackers they are not really a problem in the medium term. 

They can cause short term damage but ultimately like I said before the way I look at it is if the attacker tells you about it, they are friends it doesn't matter how much short term pain that gives you, reality is that the consequences of an attacker actually exploiting that issue with criminal intent would be way worse.

So the ones you have to really worry about are the criminals which have criminal business models. Because they will have a system, they will be persistent, they will invest on it and they will basically be focused on finding ways to make money out of your system.

So it is kind of like Murphy for Murphy law that is actual malicious, it adapts, it reacts, you know it has multiple levels of activities. So I have seen cases where you have one team that will brute force log in passwords attacks and they will discover names and passwords to make sure they work and then another team that basically knows how to use them and then another team that knows how to get the money out of the systems and that is what they are doing. 

So if you happen to hit in one of those chains, you are kind of into trouble because then the attackers will be focused on your activities.
