**Get 40 days of consulting services to kick start AppSec**

It is often easier to go to a big consulting company and ask for forty days of certain resources and let them provide them for you. If you don't have a big list of security issues or need exploits, then one option is to hire a security company for forty to sixty days, and let them review your applications across the technology spectrum, and across the platform. 

Their review won't be limited to pen tests. They will perform a complete AppSec review where they will sit with the developers and basically hack anything that moves in the organization. This allows them to produce case studies for you, and give you an idea of the risks. It is essentially a massive security test, across the board, that allows you to really understand what is going on within the company.

A second option is to hire the security consultants individually, although that might be harder initially.  The size of your company could cause a problem in this scenario if it is so big that it uses a range of different technologies.  In such a case you will struggle to hire somebody who understands all those different technologies.

A third option is to hire specific individuals from a specific consulting company. This means that not only do you have a much better talent pool to pick from, but you also have more continuity and consistency in the work they do for your company.
