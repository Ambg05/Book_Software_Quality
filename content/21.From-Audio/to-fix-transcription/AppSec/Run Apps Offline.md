### Run Apps Offline

The ability to run application offline i.e. without live dependencies of QA servers and even live servers is critical in the development process. That capability allows the developers to code at enormous speed, because usually the big delays and expensive calls are to those services allows all sorts of versioning, allows all sorts of development techniques to occur, and also signifies that the application development environment has matured to a level where you now have mocked or have created mocked versions of your dependencies.

And ideally the faster you can run the dependencies, you can even run themselves as real code. The point is are you sure to run them locally without a network connection and without an umbilical code to another system.

Of course you will always will test against those systems i.e. the test that you are going to run locally against that mocked version should also pass against the live system and if they don't that is a big deal and you have to fix it.

But when you are developing you should have all the required dependencies at that moment in time. This makes a massive difference when you are doing a new version or say a new feature where you can actually already simulate what will those dependencies do and behave, allows much better demos, allows a much quick interaction and development loop and ultimately makes developers break crazy productive.

The other thing that is very important is that that simple question; Can you run your app offline? Can you run your service offline? Can you run your application that you are coding offline? Is something that management can use to measure the pulse and the quality of the current development environment and the continuous integration of particular teams.

So, if you have three teams that code like that and one that doesn't, you could guess which team is not probably shipping every day if they could is not shipping regularly, is not able to develop things very, very quickly, respond to customers and business requirements very fast, and especially the one that every time it releases there is a whole number of bugs and QAs and one with QA cycles just to make sure things are okay.
