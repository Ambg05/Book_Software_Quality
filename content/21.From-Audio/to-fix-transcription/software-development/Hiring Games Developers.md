### Hiring Games Developers

There’s a lot that the appsec industry can learn from gaming, because they really spend a lot of time thinking about visualization, how to understand highly complex sets of data, things about the maps they create, and the kinds of ways they map the games so that it's easy for the user to understand and play. I think there’s a lot of stuff we can learn from it.

They also have a lot of interesting attacks through the extra games business logic, which is something that we could learn from, too. And more importantly, they also have a lot of great hardware that is designed for high levels of processing and graphical visualization stuff. So there’s a lot of interesting application security analysis that can be done using the gaming industry's hardware, software visualization, and concepts.

So I wonder how many of the companies actually hire games developers because as I have said, they are big assets to have and can add quite a lot of value.
