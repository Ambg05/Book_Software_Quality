**Cost of no continuous deployment (CD)**

Lack of continuous integration is very expensive. These days we can totally make the business case that if a team doesn't have continuous deployment (CD), i.e. able to build codes, decodes and ship it to servers in minutes, then we have a problem.

This means that if a team doesn't find it easy to make changes, it will struggle to refactor. It will spend time chasing ghosts, its developers spend hours and hours of their lives clicking on things, running requests or chasing requests and they are twenty to fifty percent inefficient.

Even worse, they don't build reliable applications.

These days, we can really make the business case to say that teams that don't have effective and reliable continuous deployment, will have a lot of problems of quality issues , and will have security vulnerabilities,.

So in a way, they don't have a security problem, they have a development.

Of course there are teams that have continuous deployment and  have security issues. The good news is easier to add security there, since the hard part is already done.

Note that CD is not about doing it once (every now and then), it is about doing it all the time (multiple times a day/hour), under a controlled environment, with fully tested applications and via reliable pipelines.
