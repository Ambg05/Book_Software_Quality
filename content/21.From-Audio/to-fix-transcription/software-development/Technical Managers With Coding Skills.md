### Technical Managers With Coding Skills

If you have technical managers with coding skills, it’s a waste of their talent if they’re not coding once they get promoted into a non-coding function like technical architect or business analyst or even manager.

One of the things they should be doing is actually reviewing the tests that are written by the application that they are managing, and the fact that they have technical skills and coding skills means they can do it, which is an asset that should be leveraged.

What they should be doing is that for every feature that they request or find a bug, they should be reviewing the tests that represent the fix for that particular feature. And if that’s not possible, that represents a gap in the current test environment, which needs to be addressed. So ideally what should happen is the test should be written in a DSL, which is domain specific language, which should be easy to read and should clearly describe the bug or feature that has been fixed.
