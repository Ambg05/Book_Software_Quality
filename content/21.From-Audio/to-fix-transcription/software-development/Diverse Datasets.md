**Diverse Datasets**

When developing an application, you make a nicer difference to have  a wide variety of data sets and schemers because that will force naturally the independence on the views from the data that has been used. 

For example on the maturity models project by having to support BSIMM and open SIM there is less hard coding that happens on the actual titles of the domains.

So, it is a good example of having multiple data sets push the application to have a much more independent and re-factored structure. It also allows for better testing and promotes pushing the application harder which ultimately affects security and its resilience.
