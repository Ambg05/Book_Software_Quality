**When Developer says it is not a problem.**

The developers and technical architects answer to the question, are we secure, is this a problem? Their answer is, as far as I can tell, we are okay.
This is actually something that isn't their fault, it is very easy to do, it is actually very natural, it is very human.

The problem is, unless you have a test, unless you have a test that by yes I have a test to prove it, I have total confidence, what you've asked isn't possible and by the way if it was possible we would know about it. That isn't the answer, it means that there is no proof, there is no accountability on the security and the resilience of a particular, whatever the question was.

So, imagine, well is this particular feature going to be able to hold the radioactivity from the plutonium that is on the other side, if the answer was, "well, as long as I can tell it is okay", you can totally see that that wouldn't be good enough.

So, the biggest problem isn't that, the biggest with giving that answer is that it makes the developer in a way responsible for the security of that component. It moves the responsibility from the person asking the question to the developer who basically provided a professional opinion based on his knowledge that something is no problem.

And from the management point of view, they now don't have to follow it up. Where what you really should say if you don't have evidence, you should say I don't know, I don't have enough evidence to answer that question, so I am not able to answer it.

And now it is interesting because especially if you are mapped out to a risk, then what you then have is a situation where the business person, the entity asking the question either accepts the risk which is we don't know the answer to this question, or he has to allocate resources to answer that question.

And security questions when there is work done, and when it exists, are very easy to answer by somebody. The problem is when those things don't exist, when you don't have the data, where you don't have the visibility, where you haven't done the work to create the mapping, the testing, the assurance they are very hard questions. You go from a very simple question to something hard, just something almost impossible to do in a couple of months or years. And that is in a way the interesting part.

So, the developers and the architects and the technical people absolutely shouldn't commit to an answer or to a position unless they have evidence. Unless they have tried, unless they have technical skills in that particular area which allows them to say well, as far as I can tell, this isn't a problem.
