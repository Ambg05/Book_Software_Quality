**Software complexity is good for vendors**

Software complexity from the entity selling the software or the application, as in a lot of cases they can actually use it to more because they sell support, they sell new version, they sell the fixes for the bugs they are going to do it anyway. It tells sometimes how this preserve prefers where the makers or the ones who control the software development actually like complexity because they guarantee future work.

Of course, from a security point of view that is kind of crazy because it means that the attack software gets increased, that means then half paid function is being pushed, you have all sorts of security and your bugs are being pushed.

And from a security what you really want to simple solutions is non quantifiable, in a way no bugs, no side effects work flows. Which is kind of why sometimes security goes against the actual business model of whoever is creating the software.

Ironically, some customers also reward complexity because they think they are going to have more features, they are going to be needed in the future so they are actually wanted and they also tend to ask for a lot of stuff again is the customer always right, they ask for things that introduces a huge amount of complexity. 

And what that means, it means that you have a situation where the customer asks for the complexity, the vendor delivers a complexity and then you go into this loop of keep batching the bugs. Clearly for the first place, I think more complexity makes power for me the key exercise is for the consumers to have a very good understanding of what he is actually buying into, not only the lock in index, i.e. I am locked that is risk, but also the real implication of the complexity that he is buying.

And, I have seen cases where when developer and consumers actually are exposed for some security implications are different products, usually the simple the product, the more secure it is, the more complex the product, the more insecure it is. The user will actually pick up the simpler products even if it has less features because he starts to realize that he has all the best features that he needs, the rest aren't that important in fact the rest are coming up with all this pollution.
