### Use AppSec to visualize logs

Once you've got your logs, a typical problem is how to process, and how to visualize them. This can be a problem if you try to address visualization as a whole. Where there is too much data, there is too much information, and you can be left struggling with the sheer quantity as a result.

One of the ways to manage this is to take, for example, the ELK stack, and start with a small question. You can take an AppSec question on vulnerability or something good that is happening, and you use that to create visualizations that can answer your question.

Here are some example questions: I am attempting a brute force login, can you detect it? I am exploiting a process scripting, can you detect that? Run these questions every hour to generate enough log events, and then use those requests to make sure that you have enough visibility in your log visualization.

As another example, you could also use Kibana to figure out how to write the queries, and how to actually visualize, rather than spending the time handling a huge amount of data.

This is a much more efficient way to figure out how to visualize your logs.
