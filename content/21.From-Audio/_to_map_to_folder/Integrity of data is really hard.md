### Integrity of Data is really hard.

The integrity of data is much harder property. The current problems we have is where the confidence is because property is when you start to worry about integrity, you have a massive issue of knowing where does the good data ends and the bad data begins.

So, it is very easy to recover if somebody deletes the data, if somebody does a mass modification. It is very hard if the data has been modified over time. And if the changes occurred over a period and after a while, you don't know what is good and you don't know what is bad.

Even more importantly, if you don't know what actually caused that change to occur. So, integrity is way harder.
