### creating small tests.

When opening up issues, I find that for quality, and security best practices issues, you want to open an issue which as small as possible. And the things you should be creating doesn't have those issues, especially for example doing a security assessment or doing a security pass.

This can be quite continuent to a law they like to keep their bug count small. The problem is if you don't capture those negates if information, what you do is miss a lot of knowledge, a lot of information that happens on people's heads. Especially on devs when they look at code.

And what I found is very important is that if you have a place to put all those little things and little examples, and little changes, you have a way to measure exactly what you should do on a quality pass, what you should do when you want to just clean and improve the quality of application. And you also have a great two way communication system or a sync system of communication between the devs.
So, I found that in a lot of ways, the smaller the issue the better, because it means the commit will be smaller, the tests will be smaller and that will make the whole process much more smoother.
It is also a great place for the team to collaborate and new devs can join the team. So, when the new devs joins the team, s/he should be starting with fixing those bugs and creating tests for them which would really help them to understand what is going on.
