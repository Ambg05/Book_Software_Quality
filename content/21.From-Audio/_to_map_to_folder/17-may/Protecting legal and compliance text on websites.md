### Protecting Legal and Compliance text on Websites.

To do this, you find data that has to be signed off by lawyers, for example translations or legal notices on a website. And you assign risk to them based on the QA software development life-cycle maturity.

For example, the QA ability to test the integrity of that data. So, a week SDL, an SDL where you have very little source control or you have all sorts of developers accessing it or all sorts of javascript injected on the web application for example ads and stuff like that.

That means that you aren't able to guarantee the integrity of the data that exists on the website.

And what this will do is this will highlight all sorts of gaps in a QA SDL work flow and the QA test environment. For example lead against production and check that the legal text is still there and hasn't been changed.
