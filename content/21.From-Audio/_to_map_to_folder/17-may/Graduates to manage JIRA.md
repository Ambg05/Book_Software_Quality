### Graduates to manage JIRA.
The challenges of hiring graduates to work flow will be managing and maintaining them. It can be a considerable amount of work, especially when it goes above 150 or 200 issues, which every team ideally should have.

The solution isn't to have less issues, but instead, to help improve and manage issues. Great sources of talent for the task are graduates or recently hired staff. They are inexpensive professionals that want to go into app sec, are getting acquainted with it, or just want the job to get a foot in the door at the company. It's one of those easy, win-win situations which will allow them to meet a lot of people and really get their heads around what is going on.

It will mean that the developers can actually spend time fixing the stuff instead of maintaining JIRA which will require a bit of energy and maintenance, because one of the key components of the JIRA work flow is that it is up to date. This means that the risks are accepted, followed up on, and things never going into a backlog.

We don't have things in backlog; either issues are being fixed or they are being accepted. Thing should never be in limbo.
