### Parking Ticket Karma.

You've parked your car in a place where you are supposed to pay for parking, but you forgot to buy the parking ticket and played football for two hours.  

As you walk back to the car, you realize that you forgot to make the payment. You expect to find a ticket on your car.

As it happens, you got lucky and there's no ticket. You need to go to the High Road and still one extra hour of parking.

You got away with the first two hours, so theoretically you could just pay for one hour.

Do you pay for one hour or you pay for three hours?

The answer to this question tells a lot about a person.
