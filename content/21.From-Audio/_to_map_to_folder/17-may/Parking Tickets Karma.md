### Parking Tickets Karma.

You've parked your car in a place where you are supposed to pay for parking. But you forgot to buy the parking ticket, and played football for two hours.  

As you walk back to the car, you realize that you forgot to make the payment, and expected to find a ticket.

As it happens, there was no parking penalty in the car. You need to go to the High Road and still one extra hour of parking.

Do you pay for one hour or you pay for three hours? You got away with the first two hours, so theoretically you could put just pay for one hour?

The answer to this question tells a lot about a person.
