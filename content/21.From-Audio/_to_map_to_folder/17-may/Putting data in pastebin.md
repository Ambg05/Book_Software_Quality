### Putting Data in Pastebin.

One of the best ways to make devs and management understand confidentiality of data is to ask the question, "Can we put all of the data on your database on pastebin?" Pastebin is a website that just takes data.

It's interesting, because that is the moment that you really start to think about what that database really contains. So ideally, the correct answer is yes, there is no problem. All that data could go to pastebin because the data shouldn't mean anything by itself.

That's what you really want -- you want your database to be in a situation where there is nothing truly valuable in there when it exists by itself.

So, all the sensitive data should be encrypted, all the ideas should be tokenized, there should be no way to de-anonymize that data, and every single asset in there should be random from the point of view of the database itself.
