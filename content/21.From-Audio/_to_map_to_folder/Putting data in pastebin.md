### Putting Data in Pastebin.

One of the best ways to really make devs. and management understand confidentiality of data for example stored in a database, is to ask the question, so can we put all of the data on your database on pastebin which is a website that just takes data.

And it is interesting because that is the moment that you really start to think what is inside that database and what is really there. So, ideally the right answer is yes, there is no problem. All that data could go to pastebin because the data shouldn't mean anything by itself.

And that is really what you want, you want your database to be in a situation where there is nothing really valuable in there by itself.

So, all the sensitive data should be encrypted, all the ideas should be tokenized, there should be no way to de-anonymize that data and every single asset in there should be random from the point of view of the database itself.
