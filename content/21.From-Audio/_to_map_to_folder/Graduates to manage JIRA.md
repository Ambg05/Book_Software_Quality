### Graduates to manage JIRA.
Hiring graduates to work flow, one of the challenges will be to manage and maintain all that and that can be considerable amount of work especially when it should go above the hundred and fifty and two hundred issues. Which every team ideally should have.

The solution isn't to have less issues the solution is to help to improve and manage issues. So, a great source of talent to do that is basically graduates or recently hired staffs, in a way not very expensive professionals that want to go into app sec or are getting their heads around or just want to get the job into a company.
And it is one of those easy win-win situations which will allow them to meet a lot of people, really get their heads around what is going on.

And what it will mean, it will mean that the developers can actually spend time fixing the stuff instead of maintaining JIRA which will require a bit of energy and maintenance.

Because,  one of the key components of the JIRA work flow is that it is up to date. That the risks are accepted, the risks are followed up, things should never go into a backlog.

We don't have things in backlog, either issues are being fixed or they are being accepted, they should never be in kind of limbo which state both of them have to occur so if that is to occur.
