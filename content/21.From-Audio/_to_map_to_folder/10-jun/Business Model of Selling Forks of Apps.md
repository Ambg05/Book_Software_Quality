**The Business Model of Selling A Fork.**

One open source based business model that I really like is the idea that the company or the team behind a particular open source project or open project sells a fork on the repository that is customized or is maintainable for a particular customer.

What that means is it means that a particular team develops the main application and then what you do is you buy a fork or access to a fork of that particular code base. It basically means that you can do customization, you can use it, you can basically have a follow up on that.

And what it means is that the company developing the application now has a direct connection with the client, there is a direct revenue stream which is great. Also, it creates a way for the main team to understand exactly how this software in-house has to be used, and how it gets customized and it also gives them the problem of having to maintain the different versions.

Because basically what you do is when there is a new release, you upgrade first your client's and you maintain it and you basically try to make it as transparent and as smooth as possible for them. You also have to solve the problem of customize ability and how to keep multiple versions in sync.

That is actually a great thing to do because it forces good technology engineering on the company so that they make customization a first class citizen not something that gets kind of throned as an add-on which always is going to be hacked, and it isn't going to be a very good implementation.

So, by giving the Dev team the responsibility to maintain the new versions, it forces a huge amount of good discipline of actually how to maintain all the different forks.
