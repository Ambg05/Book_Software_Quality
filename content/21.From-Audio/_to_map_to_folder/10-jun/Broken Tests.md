**Broken Tests Aren't The Problem.**

It is quite worrying how many times you hear people complaining about tests, especially unit tests. And, how the tests slow down, they aren't maintainable, they cause problems, in a way sometimes people argue that they aren't worth it.

This is very dangerous because for me what it is doing, it is promoting an idea that you don't test your code and that is just crazy. Every code change has to be tested, you have to make sure that you understand the impact of what is going on because you want to make sure you can re-factor very easily. Which is of course connected to security because the more you can re-factor the more you can secure the application, the more you can lock it down.

So, broken tests, if the solution to broken tests is to stop having those tests, removing the tests, then that is literally throwing the baby with the bath water. That is basically saying I have a problem here, instead of addressing the root cause of the problem I am going to get rid of the whole thing.

And what that tells me is that we need better ways to measure the effectiveness of tests. Tests exist, ultimately a lot of people to understand the value of tests so what we need is a much better way to understand when those tests are working, we need better metrics to understand when they are effective and make sure that we aren't basically solving the wrong problem.

The way I look at it, a really good way to measure the effectiveness of the test is to measure how empowering those tests are for developers, in fact for everybody. So you look at who writes the test, who runs the test, who is able to quickly write the test and then that will tell you how efficient the whole thing is.

This is connected to the idea that managers should also be writing code, in fact managers should be reviewing tests and writing tests, because that is something that they can do because they have technical ability.

So, bottom line is the issue of solving your test problem by getting rid of tests then you are solving the wrong problem.
