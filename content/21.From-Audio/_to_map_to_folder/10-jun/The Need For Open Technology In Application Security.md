**The Need For Open Technology In Application Security.**

There are a number of examples that we have now of technologies that have huge amount of potential that literally died or never fulfilled their potential or their opportunity because the quorum was actually closed.

And static analysis is an area that I have quite a bit of experience on, is a example of technology that because they were driven by companies that had closed engines, closed rules, they viewed closeness as one of their competitiveness in business models, technology that never really fulfilled its potential. 

And it is technology that could have changed the world, could have made the whole software world much more efficient but it didn't because it never gained the critical mass of the huge amount of people using it and benefiting in writing rules and basically really figuring out how to use it.

So what you have is when you have a closed system, only one company or one team is actually trying to figure out how to better use the technology. And sometimes the best assets aren't even available to the users that know what to do with it.

A very good example is what happens with static analysis where every single engine creates a model of the application they are analyzing which doesn't get shared with the people who actually could use that model, the developers or the security professionals.

Ironically even worse is a situation where the developers of those tools actually don't use the tools in a day to day. So they don't really even them don't know how to best use and make adventure of that technology.

So, it is no wonder those technologies tend to exist for a while, have a bunch of customers and then be sold to a bigger company and then kind of slowly die. Actually people who really understood the problem actually left and there is nobody there to actually take it forward and make big changes into that.

So the key is there is a whole number of technologies that you need an open platform, you need an open way to exchange information, to collaborate, to use it and unfortunately the proprietary model doesn't allow that.

Now the irony is that if you can create a good community, you can make money from those communities which actually that is a way you can fund and you can actually make it work. Which is by building a community selling service around that community and basically creating an environment where the people that are involved in that particular technology set go into there and use it.
