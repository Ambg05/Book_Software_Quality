**Inability To Support Multiple Versions.**

Our inability to be able to have multiple UI's or multiple versions of a particular application or a particular website at the same time and maintained in a way is a great example of how much sometimes lack of control and lack of testing we have of our environment.

Because the more in control, the more ability you have to test all the different variations, the easier it is to actually not put limitations on UI.

So in a way what you want is a situation where you have total independence between for example the back end and the front end and even multiple front ends when they are easy to re-factor which basically means they are easy to swap in and out which means it should be easy to maintain.

The fact that versions can't supports that or even allow that or even maintain that shows sometimes how very highly coupled the environment is. And it also creates this really perverse model where companies try to sell new features, new things and sometimes the customers are happy with how it was before, they are happy with a particular way the software worked or a particular work flow.

So they should be able to maintain that or even give that to somebody else that will support it. And it is the software complexity that prevents that from happening. So in a way what you have is a situation where that lack of flexibility shows sometimes a lack of control and complexity that we have in our software.

And security is affected by that because the more complex, the less understanding we have of a particular application, the more security issues you have and the more security vulnerabilities you will have.

So, sometimes from security you want stuff that is simple, there is low level of complexity, it is usable, it has this property of being very solid which sometimes can only exist after something being done for a long time and all interconnections are understood. 

And we have a really nice, solid, solution in the end which sometimes goes against some business models where they keep trying to add new things, they keep trying to in a way increase complexity which ultimately will be the thing that creates security vulnerabilities.
