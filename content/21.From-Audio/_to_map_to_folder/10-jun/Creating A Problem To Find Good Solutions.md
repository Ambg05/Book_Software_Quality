**Creating A Problem To Find Good Solutions.**

One of my favorite ways to solve a hard problem is to put myself, or my team in a situation where we have to solve a problem. And in a way those are good problems to have because they force you to solve good things, they force you to actually understand what is going on, they force you to really think about how to address it because you are not thinking theoretically about a particular issue or what will happen if this happens, what will happen if that happens. You actually have a real problem with real scenarios, real outcomes, real feedback that you are basically dealing with.

So in a way the closer you can be with the problem that you are solving, the more you can experience, the more you can visualize it, then most likely the solution you are going to come up with is a much better solution.

How many times you've heard of cases where a particular feature only was added when one of the key engineers or architect actually went on the road, met some customers and then they showed him some stuff and he says, "Ooh, that kind of sucks, I can do something better".

In a way that is far too late, that is ridiculously late, you want those feedback loops much close to home because it basically means that you want people to be solving the right problems.

And that is why feedback loops are so important because the faster the feedback loop you have, the easier it is to understand the implications of changes, the easier it is to find good solutions that are sometimes good enough for the problem that you are trying to solve. Which also prevents over engineering and over complexity.
