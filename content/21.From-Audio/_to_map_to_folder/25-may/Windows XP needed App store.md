**Windows XP needed App store**

Windows XP lack of app store meant that that platform wasn't maintained, I mean there was no commercial model built on top of maintaining just Windows XP. And that affects security because Windows XP ironically was quite a robust operating system and used and loved by a lot of users. Which if kept at times i.e. if it kept being upgraded, if it kept having changes made and improvements made in a way that it just affected the underlying technology but not the user experience you could actually have a lot of users who kept being secure.

The problem is because Microsoft stopped Windows XP or eventually Windows 7 and all the others, it got to a situation where there are literally hundreds or millions of computers installed that don't have proper patches that live in this kind of high insecure mode.

Where if you actually had for example a commercial built on top of it that means Microsoft could still make money with Windows XP, it could either sell that to somebody else to maintain it or it could just even make business sense to maintain it just by itself. And users can go in there, they could buy for example a latest version fully patched of Windows XP, they can install apps, which is a much more safe way of installing apps via an app store, versus just downloading some random thing from the internet.

And the irony is actually Windows XP was actually quite light weight, what actually means is that it could actually should run very quickly in today's environment. I guess being seen to see at what point would Windows XP be easy to torkarize or containerize in some environment than the latest versions of the operating system.

The point is that the lack of a commercial business model on top of a particular software actually meant that it wasn't maintained, it wasn't kept updated and it meant that there was no financial model to keep improving it.
