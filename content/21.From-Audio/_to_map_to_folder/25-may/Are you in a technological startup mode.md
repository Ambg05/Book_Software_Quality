**Are you in a technological start-up mode**

On application security, are you a technological start-up or are you a mature and professional company? 

Most companies are still in what can be called 'start-up mode' in regards to application security i.e. they don't control the applications, they don't really control the softness angle, they don't understand the side effects of what they are doing, they don't have app sec program.

Basically, they behave like start-ups, it is about just get out there, push the feature sales and then hope they don't get attacked. Or trust versus, by definition you are think that people won't bother attacking you, and the logical V that you eventually get and then you hire a security team, then you hire an application security team and you will really clean up your act.

The problem is, a lot of companies are still in the start-up mode, in fact what is interesting about the talk-talk attack was that one of the CEO's said as it was attacked that they were still in start-up. There are still decisions which are more suited when you are in start-up mode versus when you are a mature, large company.

So, a very good question and a very good point to make...the senior management say that we are in the point of view of technology, we are in the point of view of applications, the start-up mode.

And let's be clear, if you don't have a full app base of every single application that you have, you don't have threat models for every single one of those apps, then how do you do connections to understand side effects of what you are doing. Have code review, have security, you are in a start-up mode.
