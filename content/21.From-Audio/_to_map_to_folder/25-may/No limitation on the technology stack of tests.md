**No limitations on the technology stack and innovation level of tests**

Usually, once a team commits to a particular technology, or commits to a particular stack, very, very quickly that stack will become out of date or at least, a lot of teams will struggle to keep it up to date to the latest versions of particular available products.

And of course the more you go into the legacy world, the more you see companies running all sorts of products and soft applications aren't really with the old platforms. The big question then becomes how can we test it because that technology, that particular thing isn't good enough to test.

The irony is that you have no limitations on the quality of the tests that you are actually using, test framework that you are using. This actually means that you can use best in class latest developers, latest ideas, latest concepts, latest frameworks for your test environment.

So, there is no reason why you can't use an Node.JS application to test a .net or even ASP classic or ColdFusion or Java XYZ or .net 2.0 application. It doesn't matter as long as it goes through network traffic, as long as there is an input and an output, you can reverse engineer that and you can basically create that as a set of test suites that basically executes the application and gives you a first level of tests.

So, you can use the latest innovations, the best technology, no limitations at all, the best tools for your tests and even when you can't change the stack of the main application.
