**OS should not allow UI to be blocked.**

Operating systems should never block the UI, and should never go unresponsive. It should be a key design principle and a key concept of operating systems that they should not allow any prog, CPU or network or resources that the UI actually goes unresponsive.

It should be one of their key considerations, the protection of the actual user interface.

So, every process in a way should behave like a container and should be isolated, should have dedicated resources allocated to it in a way the user should be able to control or a process in the operating system should be able to control just like how those processes behave and how they consume. 

And if they start to behave and consume too much resources, they should be easily killed and easily be handled. 

The way they shouldn't do is just blocked in a way so that the user has a really bad experience
