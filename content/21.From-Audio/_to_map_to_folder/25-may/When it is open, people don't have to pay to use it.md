**When it is open, people don't have to pay to use it**

When making it open, gives you have no rights to control how it is used. An interesting thing that sometimes happens is people release a piece of software or information open and then get annoyed when they use it and don't pay for it as if they had a requirement to do that.

Part of the game of course is that you don't have to do that, you don't have to pay to use which is why it is open and it is free as in freedom.

Now it is actually a problem that we have in our current software development environment where you don't have a good model to pay for software that is free or content that is free. That is actually thrives of the comments because it means that the people who do that aren't able to make a living out of creating that content. 

And that is something that we need to solve as a society, we need to figure out ways to reward and to pay and to channel funds and capabilities to the people that actually can do specific work and maintain specific piece of software.
