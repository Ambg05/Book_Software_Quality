**Why SAST rules need to be customized**

The reason why it is so important to customize static analysis engines is because we need to teach the tools where resources and things are. Where the assets are, what matters, and what we really want to know.

So by customizing rules, it allows the people who understand the application to actually indicate the areas of concern. And eventually what you have is highly defensible, highly robust results that when they occur, they can be actionable.

By not allowing customization, making customization hard or a second class citizen, what the tools do is they promote the idea that it is a one button click which will do the job of which of course it doesn't.

And it really short changes the quality and the value of those engines capabilities.
