**Annual Reports should contain Info sec Part**
Annual reports should have an info sec and app sec section, they should list to the business, they should list their activities, they should provide very detailed answers to what is going on.

So, most companies have Intel dashboards of vulnerabilities, basically awareness of what is going on, that data should be published because only then, you can actually make the market work and reward companies. 

And make them understand that they need to invest and understand the pollution that happens when you have rent projects with crazy deadlines they have rented who don't really have the right resources but somehow manage to deliver.

Which in a way is due to some heroic effort from some developers, who sometimes the developers work their ass off to deliver something spectacular, management get rewarded by pushing them really hard.

And then what you end up having is this highly spectacular vulnerabilities being created and highly spectacular risks that are now being bought by the company. And they don't even realize until it blows up one day.
