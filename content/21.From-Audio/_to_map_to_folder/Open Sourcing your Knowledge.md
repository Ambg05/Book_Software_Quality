### Open Sourcing your Knowledge.

The reason you need to open source your knowledge and share what you do, is because you want to have access to those ideas and knowledge in the future. So, don't think of open sourcing as a way to show how good you are or brag or some kind of showmanship which a lot of people are shy of or even are afraid basically to show what they do because they think it isn't good enough.

The reality, that doesn't matter, what matters is whether you can still have access to those ideas in the future. Because ideas are very fragile, very ephemeral which means that they only for smalls of good time, and if you don't capture them or have a way to revive them, then you will lose it.

Especially because ideas tend to be hyper-linked, so sometimes what you need to get the best idea is to read about another idea that then you can connect the dots.

So, the reason why you need to publish your data and push it to get GitHub whatever repo or repository contains your information is because that is a way for you to find in the future.

So, a lot of the things we do on a day to day work get locked into whatever company we are working for. And some things you can argue that okay they are very preparatory, they are very unique to that company, but probably ninety percent of the time, what we do isn't quite specific to the company.

So, that means that there is no reason for that information not to be shared, for you not to have that available or even for you to be able to access that outside work.

I have some cases where I have to do something at work and then I am able to continue doing some work over the weekend or improve it and in a way it is better for everybody. And also allows of course other people to contribute, other people to share it and if you are lucky to have comments or usage then in a way you start to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.

So, I am finding these days that a great benchmark for how open my day is and how productive my environment is for how much commit do I push. So, the more commits I do, the more work I do that gets passed and released earlier and open sourced of creative comments license, the more I am saving my ideas for my future self.
