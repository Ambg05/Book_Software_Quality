**Are you a technology company?**

One of the interesting things that is happening is there are a lot of companies these days who like to call themselves technology companies. They bet on their technology, they live on their technology, in a way most of their profit proceeds come from technology.

But when you look at it, they are really not a technology company, i.e. if you look at the center of gravity, if you look at the people that control the power, the people who are making the decisions, the people that actually are influencing what is going on, that isn't usually the case.

And you could see that on the continuous development pipeline, you know if you have a company that isn't shipping software everyday or every week, who doesn't have very quick continuous deployment cycles, who doesn't have a good control of their security, who doesn't have a very good understanding of their technology stack, then they are really not technology company.

And sometimes it might be that maybe five years ago, they were on the evolution, they were there, they were a good technology company at that stage, but these days it has moved. So that is why things like containers, things like deploying stuff fast, things like controlling new technology environment, and having highly productive developers all those things matter because that is really what makes a technology company.

It is the lack of pollution, the lack of technical pollution which is basically this idea that it is the side effects of what you do that needs to be measured, that needs to be understood.

So one of the things I like sometimes to do is to go to companies and say you aren't a technology company because this is what technology companies are doing, and if you aren't doing this, then basically you aren't.

And that sometimes could be quite interesting message for top level executives because they tend to like to think that they are a technology company even ironically even from a stock market point of view, that will be a great way to evaluate that.
