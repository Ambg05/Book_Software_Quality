**When Bugs are discovered Production.**

When you have a really mature test QA and security development environment, any bug that is discovered in production is a massive problem, and should be raised as a high priority item if that bug isn't know at the moment, or not known so far.

So, if somebody finds a bug or a security problem that you are aware of, and you have already thought about it, dealt with the risk, accepted it because in a way it is in production, then that is okay. But if somebody finds something that isn't currently understood then that is a big problem. That means you just found a blind spot in your current system.

In a way what is interesting is you actually get a situation where bugs are actually celebrated, bugs are actually good things in production. Because they represent an opportunity to improve your current development environment. They represent an opportunity to find blind spots into the current work flows and to really understand why that wasn't caught in the current test suites.

And of course, you then need to look at it and figure out, okay so what test do I need to add in order to be able to detect it? And then you have a situation where in principle that kind of bug and usually you will find more because if you look at the pattern you will find other variations of the bug. You now catch the whole sequence of issues, and that is basically the key.

The key is to understand that once your environment is very mature, you shouldn't get any bugs reported to you that you don't know about. In fact, even worse is when you actually have to wait for the customer or somebody else to tell you about a bug. That represents a huge amount of lack of visibility because if you know your system, if you know what is going on, have enough visibility, have enough logs, you will catch those errors before the user does.

So, if you actually need a user to tell you, hey I can't do this function,  or when I did this, this happened or there is a bug here, or I can't check out or I can't do this particular action, or I am now seeing somebody else's data, that means that not only do you have a bug, you also don't know when it happened which is even worse.
