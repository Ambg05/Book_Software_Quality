**Shadow of a bug.**

A very interesting concept that occurs when you are programming, especially when you only have a slice of a code in your head because that is what you are trying to solve is you will see sometimes very big problems or very big security vulnerabilities. 

The problem is that if you don't capture them because they look just like a shadow, so they are like a shadow of a bug where you just see a glimpse of it but you don't see the full picture.

And what you don't have is you don't have the time to go and research the actual root cause of the problem. And this happens a lot on security issues where you look at something and go, "well that doesn't feel right, but it looks okay" or "I don't think that this could be a problem now".

Then what happens is you don't investigate that particular problem. In a way you saw a shadow but you think, well it isn't the real thing it is just a shadow, it could be a mirage, it could be just something that isn't real.

But the interesting thing is that if you have a very good test environment, a very good development work flow, it is very easy to determine if it is a shadow, if it is something real. If it is actually something that exists or not. 

The hard part is when you don't have good test environments or good development environments, those questions are really hard because nobody really knows if the issue at hand or the question at hand is a problem or not, you are left hanging with an interesting question.

And the way I look at it, not being able to answer a question is security issue in itself because it represents again the shadow of a bigger problem which is lack of understanding how the code works.
