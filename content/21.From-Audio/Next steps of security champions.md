**Next steps of security champions.**

It is very important that security champions are given the time, the focus, the mandate and the information required to do their jobs. The good news is: now that you have a security champion, their work will allow you to see the difference between the multiple teams and the multiple parts of a company who are able to make it work, and those who are struggling to understand what is going on.

The key activity of the security champions is to participate in the security activities of the company: writing tests, knowing what is going on, basically being involved in the security practices of the teams.

Security champions should also be able to spend at least one day a week on those activities which, though they are easy for management to accept, are in fact much harder to put into practice. One of the things you want to make sure you look at from a central point of view is exactly who is doing this kind of work, and who is actually able to spend the time doing it.

Some other key activities include the maintenance of security tickets of a particular project, and the creation of threat models which  ultimately provide better briefs for the application.

The good news is these things can be measured and tracked from the point of view of all the teams.
