### Website in DMZ with JDBC connection

This diagram represents an network architecture with two servers that are talking to each other via a firewall (using a JDBC connection)

The workflow is the following

1. user (in green) makes  the request to the website (box with WS)
2. the request to the website (WS) goes via a firewall that only opens port 443
3. the WS server processes the user request and makes a call to the database (over port 1433) using JDBC
4. the connection to the Database goes over another firewall, 
5. with this setup, it is considered that the Webserver (WS) is inside an DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)

The interresting question (from a security point of view)  is:

-  what happens (and this should go on a separate diagram), when the Website (WS) uses XStream (or Java Serialization) to process user controller content (xml file or binary object) which triggers RCE (Remote Code Execution) on that server.
