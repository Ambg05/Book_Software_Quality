### 5.Test execution and lack of visibility

-this graph is trying to show are unit tests execution (with attack payloads) at a regular interval

- the one at the top (on both images) represents the test execution, which is kinda of an heartbeat
- the one with the flat line (2nd drawing on 1st pic) represents lack of visibility into those attacks
- the one with the heartbeat and the extra activity (2nd drawing on 2nd pic) represents the detection of an attack
- the last drawing on the 2nd pic, represents the normal network traffic (with no ability to detect attacks)

**work in progress diagrams**

- image size should just be the graph (note the extra white space in this page)
- baseline should be flat (i.e. the only spikes are the ones created by the test execution)
- add x axis of: time
- add y axis of # of tests executed
- make the line green

![](images/Graph_02_Screenshot.png)

- image size should just be the graph (note the extra white space in this page)
- x axis: time
- y axis: # of requests
- add a couple 'mountains' (to represent more traffic)
