## Who is attacking you?

If the attacker tells you about the attack: You should Thank them

The dangerous ones are the commercially focused criminals

It’s all about the money:

 - HackingTeam 'rely on us' … to hack you …
 - HaaS (Hacking as an Service) - The devlopment of Cyber Services for hire
 - Buy botnet  for $110
 - Shopping for Zero days - How much it cost to be an ‘internal user’
 - Services that provide '100% Anti-virus non detection guarantee' (and VirusTotal)
 - Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware (www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says)

It is in the billions
 - The real criminals are running highly professional companies, with high quality software Development, Testing, QA, AB testing, etc…

Data sometimes is more important that Credit Cards
 - Ashley Madison - But the credit cards were protected

Government agencies are also starting to be an issue
