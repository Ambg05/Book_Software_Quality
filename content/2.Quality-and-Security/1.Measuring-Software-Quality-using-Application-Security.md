## Measuring Software Quality Using Application Security

Software Craftsmanship is about Software Quality

A big problem with the Craftsmanship (and testing) community is:  ‘How to define Quality'

Everybody knows that Quality is key … but … ‘How do you measure it?'

My thesis is that Application Security can be used to define and measure Quality

Application Security is all about the non-functional requirements of software (software = apps, websites, web services, apis, tools, build scripts = code)

Application Security is all about understanding  .HOW the software works

Using Application Security  I can measure the quality of software

Because Application Security  measures the unintended side effects of coding


### Where are the Software Quality teams

If a Software Quality team isn't there, where is quality going to come from?

In a way, 'the Software Quality team' is a perfect partner for the AppSec team, since there are lots of similar activities which they do.

The problem is that in a lot of companies there isn't such thing as a Software Quality team, so AppSec is a backwards way to create (or kickstart it)

In fact high-level management can use Quality and Appsec to get a more realistic understanding of which teams are performing well and which ones need help. This is also a great way to measure the real impact of 'outsourced code development activities'

### No developer creates security vulnerabilities on purpose

They don't arrive Monday morning and say "Let's write some vulns today"

### "But it wasn't supposed to be used that way!!!"

- an usual comment after the original author of the root cause of a particular vulnerability
