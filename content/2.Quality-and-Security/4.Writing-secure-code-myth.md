## Writing secure code myth

“If only software developers had security knowledge they would be able write secure code”

This is a myth because secure code has little to do with developer's skills and craftsmanship

Software security (or insecurity) is a consequence of the Software development environment  (namely the business and managers focus)

And I know that this is a myth because I cannot write ‘secure code'  when I'm programming
