## Security dodged bullets

### Early internet browsers

  - tons of buffer overflows
  - no XSS protection  

### Slammer warm

 - what could had been done if the worm was malicious

### Unprotected WIFI  

  - is wifi lack of security (history) a case study of good security or bad security?
   - what if what is happening with WIFI is a success story and good example of security being added as it is needed, as the costs of exploitation increase, when  customers start to demand and pay for security features
  - security features were added once it become popular
    - most config settings are insecure
    - securing WIFI requires InfoSec knowledge
    - lots of legacy systems still vulnerable
  - what about the thousands of victims along the way?
    - should that body-count be captured?
    - lack of data prevents lessons from being learnt
  - lack of full SSL, shows that the problem is still not THAT important
  - we should track the 'time and cost to fix - when fix is needed'
     - i.e. once a company or country decides that they want their users/citizens WIFI networks protected, how much would it cost (and take) to protect them
     - currently lots of companies and governments don't want WIFI security to improve THAT much (since they need data from it, or access to it)

### using computers as part of the 'push nuclear button' paths

  - it really worries me that the workflow that happens after the nuclear button is pressed (i.e. the order is given to fire the missile), there is a path that goes though a computer
  - if it goes through a computer, it means that the computer has the power to send launch the missiles (I hope there are other fail safe techniques, or the ability to cancel after launch)
  - I saw this on a report about the UK's nuclear capability and the mental effects of 'pressing the button'
