# Misc Topics

The content in this section are concepts that need to be added to a particular section of the book.

I'm adding them here since it is easier and faster to move the draft notes I have made on my 'analog notebook' first into this section.

The idea is that as I review them (in printed or digital format) I find the best place for them in the book's structure
