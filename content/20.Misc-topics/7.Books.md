## Books

### A book is a souvenir of an idea [^seth-godin-office-interview]

- You see a book and remember something. They are like old friends
- "Radio is like theater of the mind, you would hear things but you would have to put the pictures on in your head, books are even more than that, because you don't even hear it, you have to add the voice in your head,and what is magic about books, it is the only form of media that can be reliably produced by mostly only person, but that stands the test of time" [^seth-godin-office-interview]
- weirdly I know where my physical books are (and I have thousands of books). I don't know how many eBooks I have (and where they 'are')
 - eBooks are good for novels and things you will only read once.
 - I don't find them useful for knowledge (for that we have the internet, google and stack-overflow)
- I had to give a number of books away when moving from an office and I still miss them

### Bookshelfs

- Every Bookshelf tells a story
  - It is a lifetime of collected changes
  - What is your company story?
  - What is in your company's library?
    - Do you even have one?


### How many Fs can you see

_FINISHED FILES ARE THE RESULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY COMBINED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS_ [^the-smarter-screen--how-many-fs]

- "How any f's did you find? The popular answer is six (if you got the answer wrong, it's probably because you missed the f's in 'of')"
- "The nonrandom nature of eye movements has big implications for the layout of information on screens"

### The Smarter Screen [^the-smarter-screen]

  - _"... a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention"_
  - _"... so what would happen if we treated attention as a literal resource? I think we'd do a better job of learning to value it"_
  - _"... what I want to do is find a way to value our attention for purposes other than advertising dollars"_
  - _"... treating attention like a valued resource would come with a significant ancillary benefit: we could learn how to improve human behavior"_
  - _"... if we want to help people make better decisions in the future, then we need to understand the psychology of screens, and how people make choices in an age of too much information and too little working memory"_
  - _"... try to figure out how to maximize the impact of this precious and scarce mental resources"_
  - _"...the nature of attention"_
  - _"... tools slowing the mind down"_
  - _"... power of subliminal priming"_
  - _"... we like to think of ourselves as rational animals, fully aware of our preferences and their reasons. And yet, decades of psychological science clearly demonstrates that many of our choices, behaviors, and beliefs are rooted in processing that takes place before we even know what we're perceiving"_
  - _"... the future belongs to those who can engineer attention"_  
  - _"... one of the most powerful tools for influencing attention is also one of the simplest, screen location"_
    - question: where are the developers looking at when programming
    - shows how important the IDE is
  - _"... the volunteers were then given extensive feedback about their predictions - they learned when they were right and more important, when they were wrong - and taught how to avoid the most common cognitive errors.... after 3 years ... led to the emergence of 'super-forecasters, people who consistently beat other experts and algorithms' "_
    - on topic of most experts have really bad results, and are just marginally better than random choices
  - _"Tetlock's research demonstrates, in a real-world setting, that effective feedback is a key element of effective thinking"_
      - reason why REPLs are so powerful
  - _"... create an 'outcome relevant learning structure' in which people receive constant updates about the accuracy of their forecasts"_
    - and decisions
    - analogy with 'side effects of coding'
    - (...link to chapter about Devs making critical decisions all the time...)
