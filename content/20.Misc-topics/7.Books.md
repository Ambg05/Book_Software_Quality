## Books

### A book is a souvenir of an idea [^seth-godin-office-interview]

- You see a book and remember something. They are like old friends
- "Radio is like theater of the mind, you would hear things but you would have to put the pictures on in your head, books are even more than that, because you don't even hear it, you have to add the voice in your head,and what is magic about books, it is the only form of media that can be reliably produced by mostly only person, but that stands the test of time" [^seth-godin-office-interview]
- weirdly I know where my physical books are (and I have thousands of books). I don't know how many eBooks I have (and where they 'are')
 - eBooks are good for novels and things you will only read once.
 - I don't find them useful for knowledge (for that we have the internet, google and stack-overflow)
- I had to give a number of books away when moving from an office and I still miss them

### Bookshelfs

- Every Bookshelf tells a story
  - It is a lifetime of collected changes
  - What is your company story?
  - What is in your company's library?
    - Do you even have one?
