## Ideas and To-do


to do:
- [ ] Information Security vs Application Security
- [ ] Marked for security disclosure is not working
- [ ] Wifi security case study
- [ ] Why I like the term cyber security , cyber attacks and cyber crime
- [ ] Development teams are made of non-experienced developers who don't understand the application they are writing
- [ ] QA teams need to have developers good enough to be hired by the dev team
- [ ] Food analogy for software, one ingredient can ruin the whole thing
- [ ] one of the probs in software is it's lack real isolation between layers (vs nature that has)
- [ ] coding in 'the zone'
Real-stories of Vulnerabilities discovered (and map them to quality or testing issues)
- [ ] Login by pass via checkbox
- [ ] Mortgage application which allowed direct access to specific screen
- [ ] ModelAttribute vuln in Mortgage application base class
- [ ] add reference to story about evolution of Ramsonware ('ok panic now')
- [ ] add XStream stories and research
- [ ] add examples from series of my blog posts written about what is really needed to test a webservice. Analogy with food components mappings (or calories counting). Doesn't matter if it complex, what matters is that is can be done
- [ ] add graph (and link article/blog-post) that showed the security cost of technology (to society) intersecting with the value of technology (to society)
- [ ] add page to frontmatter with the diagrams that exit in the book (hyperlinked if seen on the web)
- [ ] review recommendations in "How InfoSec Security Controls Create Vulnerability",https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/johnla/2016/02/20/how-infosec-security-controls-create-vulnerability/
- [ ] Review @oneraindrop
  - [ ] "Security, Fast and Slow" 1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2015/04/security-fast-and-security-slow.html
