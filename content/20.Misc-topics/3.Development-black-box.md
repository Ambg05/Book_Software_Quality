## Development Black Box

### story: Golf cart with Jet engine

- how lots of development occur
- management requirements not taking into account the current brief
- past success doesn't mean future success


## Management expectation of deadlines

- for them it is all black magic
 - lack of knowledge of how software works is sometimes seen as a good thing
 - not coincidence that some of the best teams have highly technical management
- they know it is going to be missed (and push their requirements with that expectation)
- in a way this is not management problem (blame the game, not the players)
- Management is just playing the game using the metrics they control and have visibility (features and deadlines). This is why it is so important to make them 'pay' (i.e. take responsibility) for the risk (i.e. non functional requirements) of the apps they are responsible for
