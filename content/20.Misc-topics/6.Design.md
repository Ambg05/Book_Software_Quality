## Design

- Design as 'the experience' not has 'what it looks like'
- Sometimes the best way to find the answer is to ask a better questions
- Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick two
- Simple is really hard
 - The true master makes it look really easy
  - The footballer that has the extra second
  - The Musician whose finders seem to flow from one position into another (basically already planning for the next notes as they play the current ones)
  
### Microsoft and complexity
 - Microsoft was expert in building complex systems (in fact it looked like it was part of their business model)
 - Johnathan Ive story about designing for the best way to solve a problem, and if it happened to be different, then that was ok (but making it different was not the objective)
 - Story of how Microsoft was always beaten up for not innovating, and when they did (with Metro and windows 8), everybody said: 'Not like that!!! Bring back the previous one'  
 - Story of sending a Microsoft developer to the 'UI' team as punishment for handling a developer that kept writing insecure code (not sure if this is a true story, but it does sound right).
  - "At Apple when the designer walks in, everybody stands up" (again probably a myth)
