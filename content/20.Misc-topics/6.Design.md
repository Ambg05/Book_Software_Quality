## Design

- Design as 'the experience' not has 'what it looks like'
- Sometimes the best way to find the answer is to ask a better questions
- Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick two
- Simple is really hard
 - The true master makes it look really easy
  - The footballer that has the extra second
  - The Musician whose finders seem to flow from one position into another (basically already planning for the next notes as they play the current ones)

### Microsoft and complexity
 - Microsoft was expert in building complex systems (in fact it looked like it was part of their business model)
 - Johnathan Ive story about designing for the best way to solve a problem, and if it happened to be different, then that was ok (but making it different was not the objective)
 - Story of how Microsoft was always beaten up for not innovating, and when they did (with Metro and windows 8), everybody said: 'Not like that!!! Bring back the previous one'  
 - Story of sending a Microsoft developer to the 'UI' team as punishment for handling a developer that kept writing insecure code (not sure if this is a true story, but it does sound right).
  - "At Apple when the designer walks in, everybody stands up" (again probably a myth)

### Apple's design

  - As in what Apple does
  - Companies still don't understand Apple and how it approaches design
    - is it all about trying Fast
    - story of my rant to shop owners 'just go and copy the Apple store'
  - the myth that Apple doesn't do market research
    - of course they do
    - the interesting where user this they research it on (which is usually themselves)

### Steve Jobs on Design

  - This is a great interview 'Steve Jobs on Design' [^jobs-on-design] that really covers why Apple get's design

    - Jobs: "Design is a really loaded word, I don't know what it means. So we don't really talk about Design around here, we just talk about how things work. Ahh, most people think it is how they look, but its not really how they look, its how they work."
    - Ive: "I think Steve is a design champion by action, not by talking about design. it's that he is a collaborator, he really understand design, not academically, but as a participant.
    - Woman: "Steve not only is a champion of design, but creates an environment for designers that is conducive to producing terrific work"
    - Jobs: Everyone says 'I want to make a great product', so there is no difference there, but there is a big difference in the outcomes
    - Ive: "When we were developing the new iMac, we where at was a point where we had a couple solutions that we at the time ,I think we thought that were good. But we had that sinking filing, when you start to be aware that you were trying to convince yourself that something is actually better, that in your heard you really know that it is "
    - Jobs: "Sometimes you just have to look at yourself and go, you know, it's just not really great, it's ok, it's good, but lets not fool our selfs and call it great"
    - Ive: "Steve really felt we could do better, and we all realized we need to.
    - Jobs: "And that is a hard, hard call to make, when you either throw something away because it is not great, and try again when all the pressures of commerce are at your back saying, No you can't do that"
    - Ive: "Steve is so much more than a supporter of Design, he not only has a very clear sense of vision and sense of the future, but has this sort of unnerving ability to describe the future in a way that is very inclusive, that draws people form many different disciplines into share this sense of what this vision could be "

### We need this attention detail and quality on Software

### How much money is spent on Software Quality and Dev environment

  - given its positive impact to the business, much more efforts and resources should be spent on improving the Quality of the apps being developed

### How much money is spent on Dev environment

  - The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a key part of the developer's productivity and well being.
  - it should be seen as a critical asset (with efforts spent on improving it)
    - cross company collaboration (via Open Source projects) would make this a much more effective efforts
    - Eclipse IDE is better now, but note how a couple years ago there were very little effort being put into the main IDE  
      - (Story of how the Eclipse IDE was failing the UI Automation tests)
      - (Story of how IntelliJ continuous improvement and quick release cycle made it a major success story)
