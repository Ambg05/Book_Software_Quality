## The zone

### The Zone in music

- this was where I really started to experience it and realized that it is both a mental and physical experience
- Everything becomes clear and easy
- What great bass players have
- Success is 99% perspiration and 1% talent (John Gilbey (confirm))

#### Why music and programming are so similar

- attract similar crowds
- lots of programmers (and security professionals) also code
- music learning also has a lot of deep work (and undivided attention/focus)
- OWASP Band case study
 - "SQL Injection blues" :)

### Rubik's cube

- Great practice
- Not that hard to solve (once the core sequence and algorithms are learned)
- Interesting part is to really understand what is going on
- Good to focus

### Taking notes by hand is better

An interesting research (find reference) found that students that take notes using a physical notebook have better comprehension than students that take notes using laptops.

This can be related to the fact that we can type without looking at the keyboard (so there are less senses involved and less connections made in the brain)

Same problems occur when we receive navigation instructions when driving (versus learning the path and creating references along the way)

- it could be that when we do this 'half-focused' tasks, we do the WHAT, but not the WHY or HOW
- writing creates a better hyperlinked result
- when we write we have to look at the page that we are writing into

### Coding by hand

This chain of thought actually takes us to an interesting question which is: 'Are the situations where we should Code on Pen and Paper?'

- cases where syntax doesn't matter (or can be easily corrected)
- cases where the focus is on quality, structure, form?
- coding by hand is what we do when we start drawing diagrams on white boards
