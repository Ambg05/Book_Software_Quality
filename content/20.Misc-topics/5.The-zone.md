## The zone

### The Zone in music

- this was where I really started to experience it and realized that it is both a mental and physical experience
- Everything becomes clear and easy
- What great bass players have
- Success is 99% perspiration and 1% talent (John Gilbey (confirm))

#### Why music and programming are so similar

- attract similar crowds
- lots of programmers (and security professionals) also code
- music learning also has a lot of deep work (and undivided attention/focus)
- OWASP Band case study
 - "SQL Injection blues" :)

### Rubik's cube

- Great practice
- Not that hard to solve (once the core sequence and algorithms are learned)
- Interesting part is to really understand what is going on
- Good to focus
