## Diagrams to create

### the dangerous and hard path of the 'research tangent'

- (in page 23' of small black book)
  (y-axis is the value delivered)
  (x-axis is the project's time)

 - over the project timescales, the value starts to be negative and keeps growing negatively as time-goes-by (until there is deliverable)
 - by the end of the graph there is an inflection point on the graph, with a high upwards acceleration, which then passes by another line was started linearly from the beginning

  - happens when one decides to build a tool to help with the current task.
    - for example a tool to parse DWR (Java's Dynamic Web Remoting) services
  - this means that until the tool works we are actually delivering negative value to the customer
    - because while we are building the tool, we are not working on the task at hand

  - This (diagram) is why our are brains prefer to:
    - do something safe, not very effective, but with slow and predictable deliverables
    vs
    - do something risky but highly effective (if it works)

  - "(the bicycle analogy might be a good one to make here)
    - Computers are like a bicycle for our minds" [^jobs-bicycle]
