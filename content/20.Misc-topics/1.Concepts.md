## Concepts

## Back to basics engineering

- Mechanical/Physical things have really good properties
 - standards
 - metrics
 - components
 - peer review
 - predictability
- We need to learn from them

### Battlestar Galactica

- Was not attacked due to use of 'legacy' technlogy
- Resilience
- Resilient systems
- Based on Physical, not on software
- At the moment we are having a movement towards adding software to everything ('Software XYZ' concept from JL book) which is a mistake.
  - I think we should be using technlogy to create more physical systems, which are simpler to understand, model and control. In a way, software is too malleable for its own good

### Makers movement
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - 3D printing
 - Community
 - Funding
- Maker's book

### What technology wants

- reference book
- Inevitability of technologies
- Amish community evaluation of new technologies is a good thing (we need to do more of it for software)
- not all technology is good (myth of digital)

## Open Source model

### Collaborative Commons
- 'Zero marginal cost' book
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - Communication (```Internet of ...```)
 - Power (```Internet of ...```)
 - Logistics (```Internet of ...```


## Legacy apps

- really bad concept
- all code will become legacy
- don't call it legacy, call it live (specially when the legacy code is making the money)
- keep improving and refactoring legacy code (as in a 'replace in context' change). Keep improving it, and making it better.
  - this approach is more cost effective than 'just maintaining it' and dealing with what is wrong (by depressed and non-motivated developers)
  - make it so that there is a fair competing level-playing field between the 'legacy' and the new stuff (which needs to be significantly better)
  - lack of doing this is why a large number of IT/software projects fail

## Why IT projects fail

- understand root causes, and why lessons don't tend to be learnt  

## Trillions

- Code behaves like this
 - Lots of small nodes all interacting with each other

### Thinking in Trillions

### Trillions Book

- Make reference to the Trillions book and presentation
- Bigger mountain of Trillions
- Nature has figure it out
- Make reference to 'Containers' presentation (and how they predicted Docker)


## Past in messy, Future is smooth

- From 'Lucky years' book
- Idea that when we look at the past we see the changes and understand them, but when we look at the future we tend to think that it is going to be smooth

## Software has an Hive Mind

## How Appsec team are created
- an attack
- create team with budget
- fix main issues
- lose focus, don't ask real important questions (and address the real issues)
- back to business as usual

The loop above used to work for a long time (because the number of attack and attackers was low)


## Humans adjust to technology

- Jaron Lanier 'You are not a gadget' book
- Creates problem where we expect our software and technology to not work
- We also sometimes make the technology look cleaver (because we changed our behavior)
