## Concepts

## Back to basics engineering

- Mechanical/Physical things have really good properties
 - standards
 - metrics
 - components
 - peer review
 - predictability
- We need to learn from them

### Battlestar Galactica

- Was not attacked due to use of 'legacy' technlogy
- Resilience
- Resilient systems
- Based on Physical, not on software
- At the moment we are having a movement towards adding software to everything ('Software XYZ' concept from JL book) which is a mistake.
  - I think we should be using technlogy to create more physical systems, which are simpler to understand, model and control. In a way, software is too malleable for its own good

### Makers movement
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - 3D printing
 - Community
 - Funding
- Maker's book

### What technology wants

- reference book
- Inevitability of technologies
- Amish community evaluation of new technologies is a good thing (we need to do more of it for software)
- not all technology is good (myth of digital)

## Open Source model

### Government code should be open sourced

- also applicable to companies like BBC or NHS
- see recent white-house open source document Paper

### Collaborative Commons
- 'Zero marginal cost' book
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - Communication (```Internet of ...```)
 - Power (```Internet of ...```)
 - Logistics (```Internet of ...```

## Why IT projects fail

- understand root causes, and why lessons don't tend to be learnt  

## Trillions

- Code behaves like this
 - Lots of small nodes all interacting with each other

### Thinking in Trillions

### Trillions Book

- Make reference to the Trillions book and presentation
- Bigger mountain of Trillions
- Nature has figure it out
- Make reference to 'Containers' presentation (and how they predicted Docker)


## Past in messy, Future is smooth

- From 'Lucky years' book
- Idea that when we look at the past we see the changes and understand them, but when we look at the future we tend to think that it is going to be smooth



### Mixing code and data

- the root causes of all injection issues
- explain what it is and its history

### Software has an Hive Mind

### Software is a weird material

- no good analogy with real world
 - very strong
 - very fragile

### Software Fragility

  - code Fragility concept
  - code needs to be able to defend agains today's and future threats [^rugged]

[^rugged]: Rugged handbook: https://www.ruggedsoftware.org/documents/   

### mock 'incident press releases'

  - good strategy for exposing to senior management (and boards) what is the current reality (i.e. "we are not secure in XYZ , so we better prepare for an incident")
  - simulation of the kind of press releases that would need to be send (based on the incident)
    - use quotes from real life examples (from past breaches)     
  - it is hard to write these docs in 'peace time' (i.e. when not under attack), image the stress when in the middle of an incident (specially when the full extent of the breach is not fully know)
    - story of 'escape from Alcatraz and the incident response plans the director retrieve from the vault'
  - get board to sign-off on an incident response plans and on insurance
     - data needs to be backed up by cost estimates

## How Appsec team are created
- an attack
- create team with budget
- fix main issues
- lose focus, don't ask real important questions (and address the real issues)
- back to business as usual

The loop above used to work for a long time (because the number of attack and attackers was low)





## Whistleblowers

- The value of whistleblowers in software security
- The Wikileaks model (see wikipedia description)
- Snowden leaked NSA tools
- We need to allow consumers to make good security decisions
 - What happens when the state of apps is disclosed?
 - Will all security reviews stop? (of course not)
 - What will happen is that the ones that have a good story will shine, and the others wont
- Market of lemons (analogy)

## Custom browsers
 - larger companies and dev teams should be looking at creating their own custom browsers
 - allow extra protections and lock down websites that can be accessed
 - start browser in low priv mode (maybe even inside a docker container)

### Aviator browser

 - Aviator from Whitehat was a great attempt at creating a security focused browser
   - unfortunately it really didn't gain momentum and looks pretty much dead these days
     - good news is that they open source it, so future developments could occur
     - open source happened too late
     - open source doesn't mean that a community will appear
     - open sourcing an app, clears the agenda of the original development teams
     - there was a decision make to really fork the code (vs adding changes via plugins)
       - this made it much harder to maintain Aviator and keep it in sync with the main Chrome releases
       - made it harder to secure (since changes where being make to core components)
     - vulnerabilities were discovered with Aviator
     - a good relationship with Chrome main dev team was not seen as a priority (with a couple high-profile non-very-friendly blog posts swapped between teams)  
     - Aviator did raise the very important question that our browser's current business model is based on advertising and not on protecting the user's privacy (although Firefox seems to be trying to change their north)
       - this business model means that browser features that prevent ads are not seen as a priority (as can be see by the current Ad-blocking incidents)

### Blaming the user

  - the craziness of blaming the users for clicking on links
  - blaming the users for devs for security problems and incidents is diagnosing the wrong disease (i.e. problem)

### Waiting for Superman

  - systems that are designed to only work when Superman is leading (see US movie about education)
  - the myth of the super developer (which is not really a particular developer as much as a 'developer in the zone')

### When devs game the system to write secure code

Great developers will hack the system in order to allow them to create secure apps/code, even when they are not explicitly asked to do so (see 'Android security presentation').

But this is wrong, since these developers should not have to use their political capital (or energy) like this.

### Active contributors to FOSS projects consumed

  - there are numerous advantages for companies to allow their employees (i.e. devs) to actively participate (in )
    - don't pay the Open source tax
    - have in-house developers that know deeply about how it works
    - direct personal contacts with framework developers (which can be used to directly report bugs/fixes, or ask hard questions about a particular problem)

### Pay devs to read and go to conferences

  - learning has to be an key part of a developer's job
  - technology is moving fast, and it is key that there is time to experiment and lean new things


### Open source has a way to collaborate externally internally

  - interesting situation that occur when multiple teams from the same company are the main contributors to an Open Source project
    - why is that?
    - in most companies it is hard to collaborate and for teams to send PR between them
    - ironically it is easier to collaborate when the code is in a external Open Source repo
    - this is easy to understand when one things of the typical political fights that occur in corporate environments


### The importance of Data Integrity and Availability

  - the problem of data confidentiality is very small when compared with the problems that can be caused by attacks to data Integrity or data Availability
  - Whitehat
  - add reference to US FBI direct that was talking about how he worried about the data that is using to make real-world decisions (like firing a missile)
  - what we have seen today (with data confidentiality attacks) is na warm up for what is comming next
  - this (lack of focus on Integrity and Availability) shows blind spots in the current pain threshold of companies/society and the existing regulations
  - the core of Stuxnet's payload was an data integrity attack

### Story: What would happen if the database with financial data was corrupted over time

- the company would collapse
- can they ask their users 'so .... how much money do you owe us'?

### Story: Airline security,

 - 'After this course, I take Credit Card fraud anytime....'
 - the non-financial assets can be much more important
 - how to crash a plane?


### Programmers Dignity

 - analogy with musicians [^wotf]
   - code for dinner
 - nano-payments for Programmers
   - asks the question: 'which code is important'

[^wotf]: (Jaron Lanier 'Who owns the future')

### Hacking like is 1999

  - our networks are still one exploit (or zero-day) away from major compromise
    - prob is that the applications that control the data/assets are not understood (this should be 'canary' for companies, which should not accept that state of affairs)
    - prob is that the code running those apps is not understood
    - when major data is changed (like stock prices or bank balances)  after an malware infection, the root cause is not the machine that was owned but the applications that allowed the malicious traffic to be accepted and executed

### The big myth if the Internal Network

  - There is no such thing as an 'Internal Network'
    - At best you have an 'not directly connected to the internet'
  - broken by SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery), CSRF or RCE on server side control
  - If there is a connection to the internet, it is not Air Gapped
  - mention Dan K research on DNS Pinning
  - (explain NGrok, use has example of how easy it is to create an 'internet accessible' proxy into internal network)
    - show how easy it is to do this using node
      - mention Node-ssl-strip project: https://github.com/o2platform/node-ssl-strip

### The further you are away from the internet:

... the more you are in danger
... the more damaging the attacker will Berners-Lee
... the more focused the attacker will be
... the less you will know about it
... the less likely the attacker will tell you about the attack

but the good news it at also

... the more effective your defense can be (if they exist)


  - this means that we currently do the opposite, we care about the 'internet' exposed assets, and ignore the 'Internal Network'

  - story about giving the management the option to have one of two types of data leaked into the interweb:
    1. PII and Credit Card data
    2.  data from their clients/users usage (transactions, what they did on the site, etc...)
  - most will pic #1 (but after explaining that #1 is just a fine and #2 could bring the business down, most change their mind to #2)
    - story of airline trianing which at the end the comment: 'Wow, I never thought of software that way. I'll take credit card fraud any day (vs software attacks that can bring planes down, or ground fleets)

### There is no such thing as the average developer

- the environments need to fit the individual rather than the average
- See [When U.S. air force discovered the flaw of averages](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html) the 'average pilot' (whose measurements there were used on cockpit design) did not exist: _"...But once we showed them the average pilot was a useless concept, they were able to focus on fitting the cockpit to the individual pilot. That’s when things started getting better..."_ , "_By discarding the average as their reference standard, the air force initiated a quantum leap in its design philosophy, centered on a new guiding principle: individual fit. Rather than fitting the individual to the system, the military began fitting the system to the individual."_ , excerpt from [The End of Average](http://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062358363/the-end-of-average)
- we need to apply the same concept to developers and their IDEs (paying attention on how they code and how they setup their development environment)
