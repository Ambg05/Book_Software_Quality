## Concepts

## Back to basics engineering

- Mechanical/Physical things have really good properties
 - standards
 - metrics
 - components
 - peer review
 - predictability
- We need to learn from them

### Battlestar Galactica

- Was not attacked due to use of 'legacy' technlogy
- Resilience
- Resilient systems
- Based on Physical, not on software
- At the moment we are having a movement towards adding software to everything ('Software XYZ' concept from JL book) which is a mistake.
  - I think we should be using technlogy to create more physical systems, which are simpler to understand, model and control. In a way, software is too malleable for its own good

### Makers movement
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - 3D printing
 - Community
 - Funding
- Maker's book

### What technology wants

- reference book
- Inevitability of technologies
- Amish community evaluation of new technologies is a good thing (we need to do more of it for software)
- not all technology is good (myth of digital)

## Open Source model

### Collaborative Commons
- 'Zero marginal cost' book
- Intersection between (```check list```):
 - Communication (```Internet of ...```)
 - Power (```Internet of ...```)
 - Logistics (```Internet of ...```


## Legacy apps

- really bad concept
- all code will become legacy
- don't call it legacy, call it live (specially when the legacy code is making the money)
- keep improving and refactoring legacy code (as in a 'replace in context' change). Keep improving it, and making it better.
  - this approach is more cost effective than 'just maintaining it' and dealing with what is wrong (by depressed and non-motivated developers)
  - make it so that there is a fair competing level-playing field between the 'legacy' and the new stuff (which needs to be significantly better)
  - lack of doing this is why a large number of IT/software projects fail

## Why IT projects fail

- understand root causes, and why lessons don't tend to be learnt  

## Trillions

- Code behaves like this
 - Lots of small nodes all interacting with each other

### Thinking in Trillions

### Trillions Book

- Make reference to the Trillions book and presentation
- Bigger mountain of Trillions
- Nature has figure it out
- Make reference to 'Containers' presentation (and how they predicted Docker)


## Past in messy, Future is smooth

- From 'Lucky years' book
- Idea that when we look at the past we see the changes and understand them, but when we look at the future we tend to think that it is going to be smooth



### Mixing code and data

- the root causes of all injection issues
- explain what it is and its history

### Software has an Hive Mind

### Software is a weird material

- no good analogy with real world
 - very strong
 - very fragile

### Software Fragility


## How Appsec team are created
- an attack
- create team with budget
- fix main issues
- lose focus, don't ask real important questions (and address the real issues)
- back to business as usual

The loop above used to work for a long time (because the number of attack and attackers was low)


## Humans adjust to technology

- Jaron Lanier 'You are not a gadget' book
- Creates problem where we expect our software and technology to not work
- We also sometimes make the technology look cleaver (because we changed our behavior)

## Software business model

- The broken business model of software
- probs of small firms with financing research (unless it is closed)
- Microsoft and Oracle licensing aggressive tactics

### How Software is priced

- Doesn't matter how crazy your pricing model is, there is always a customer that will buy it (specially in security, where a large part of the market is driven by FUD)
 - This makes it hard to have a realistic price
- Not a good sign: "No public price" (for example on website)
 - the sales strategy is to try to get as much money from a customer as possible (i.e. answering with "How much money do you have?" or "How much is it worth for you?" to the question "How much does it cost?")
- In a lot of cases what ends up happing is that the customer is 'ripped off' and ends up buying a lot of very expensive 'Shelfware'
- In other markets some might call some software pricing a cartel

### Open Source pricing

- 'No price' is not 'no cost'
- Too many companies use Open Source just because it is 'free' (as in no cost).
 - Microsoft had a a good point when it showed the real cost of Open Source (of course they where bias)
- All software has cost
- As with websites, "If you are not paying, you are the product"
- The real cost of software (namely apps and dependencies) needs to be taken into account

## Software Security business model

- How for a lot of companies it doesn't make business sense to write secure code and better at security than their competitors
- Story: Running faster than bears (and what happens with Sharks)
- Story: 'CMS Security review' case study:
 - all apps where bad (large number of security vulns discovered)
 - even after reporting the issues, one of the vendors presentations keep talking about how secure their product was (and how many large customers they had (logos included))
 - Customer picked the 'least worse' (and simpler solution)
 - No product's customers were advised of the issues reported
 - Good example of broken business model, since there is very small business impact for writing insecure code (and apps with lots of vulnerabilities)
 - we should be rewarding good security (with sales and leads)

### MDD - Marketing Driven Development

- At the moment there is not way to objectively compare the security of N software products or N websites
 - It's all marketing driven

## Whistleblowers

- The value of whistleblowers in software security
- The Wikileaks model (see wikipedia description)
- Snowden leaked NSA tools
- We need to allow consumers to make good security decisions
 - What happens when the state of apps is disclosed?
 - Will all security reviews stop? (of course not)
 - What will happen is that the ones that have a good story will shine, and the others wont
- Market of lemons (analogy)

## Custom browsers
 - larger companies and dev teams should be looking at creating their own custom browsers
 - allow extra protections and lock down websites that can be accessed
 - start browser in low priv mode (maybe even inside a docker container)

### Aviator browser

 - Aviator from Whitehat was a great attempt at creating a security focused browser
   - unfortunately it really didn't gain momentum and looks pretty much dead these days
     - good news is that they open source it, so future developments could occur
     - open source happened too late
     - open source doesn't mean that a community will appear
     - open sourcing an app, clears the agenda of the original development teams
     - there was a decision make to really fork the code (vs adding changes via plugins)
       - this made it much harder to maintain Aviator and keep it in sync with the main Chrome releases
       - made it harder to secure (since changes where being make to core components)
     - vulnerabilities were discovered with Aviator
     - a good relationship with Chrome main dev team was not seen as a priority (with a couple high-profile non-very-friendly blog posts swapped between teams)  
     - Aviator did raise the very important question that our browser's current business model is based on advertising and not on protecting the user's privacy (although Firefox seems to be trying to change their north)
       - this business model means that browser features that prevent ads are not seen as a priority (as can be see by the current Ad-blocking incidents)

### Blaming the user

  - the craziness of blaming the users for clicking on links
  - blaming the users for devs for security problems and incidents is diagnosing the wrong disease (i.e. problem)

### Waiting for Superman

  - systems that are designed to only work when Superman is leading (see US movie about education)
  - the myth of the super developer (which is not really a particular developer as much as a 'developer in the zone')

### When devs game the system to write secure code

Great developers will hack the system in order to allow them to create secure apps/code, even when they are not explicitly asked to do so (see 'Android security presentation').

But this is wrong, since these developers should not have to use their political capital (or energy) like this.
