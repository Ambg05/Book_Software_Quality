## Concepts

## Battlestar Galactica

- Was not attacked due to use of 'legacy' technlogy
- Resilience
- Resilient systems
- Based on Physical, not on software
- At the moment we are having a movement towards adding software to everything ('Software XYZ' concept from JL book) which is a mistake.
  - I think we should be using technlogy to create more physical systems, which are simpler to understand, model and control. In a way, software is too malleable for its own good

## Legacy apps

- really bad concept
- all code will become legacy
- don't call it legacy, call it live (specially when the legacy code is making the money)
- keep improving and refactoring legacy code (as in a 'replace in context' change). Keep improving it, and making it better.
  - this approach is more cost effective than 'just maintaining it' and dealing with what is wrong (by depressed and non-motivated developers)
  - make it so that there is a fair competing level-playing field between the 'legacy' and the new stuff (which needs to be significantly better)
  - lack of doing this is why a large number of IT/software projects fail

## Why IT projects fail

- understand root causes, and why lessons don't tend to be learnt  

## Trillions

- Code behaves like this
 - Lots of small nodes all interacting with each other

### Thinking in Trillions

### Trillions Book

- Make reference to the Trillions book and presentation
- Bigger mountain of Trillions
- Nature has figure it out
- Make reference to 'Containers' presentation (and how they predicted Docker)


## Past in messy, Future is smooth

- From 'Lucky years' book
- Idea that when we look at the past we see the changes and understand them, but when we look at the future we tend to think that it is going to be smooth

## Software has an Hive Mind
