## Abusing the definition of Unit-Test

I tend to use Tests with capital T to mean tests executed by an Unit-Test framework


### Testing is like maths

- key to understand what is going on
- common language between team members (testers, management, developers, architects, business owners)
- foundation of software engineering
- ... the crazy ideas that it is somehow ok for management not to understand technology, but is it ok for him to make key decisions about technology and software
 - if quality is not a key demand and expected deliverable, it will not happen
 - 
 
### Testing Frameworks

For me a test is anything that can be executed with one of these Unit Test Frameworks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks
