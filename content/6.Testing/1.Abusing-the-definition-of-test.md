## Abusing the definition of Unit-Test

I tend to use Tests with capital T to mean tests executed by an Unit-Test framework


### Testing is like maths

- key to understand what is going on
- common language between team members (testers, management, developers, architects, business owners)
- foundation of software engineering
- ... the crazy ideas that it is somehow ok for management not to understand technology, but is it ok for him to make key decisions about technology and software
 - if quality is not a key demand and expected deliverable, it will not happen
 
 
### Testing Frameworks

For me a test is anything that can be executed with one of these Unit Test Frameworks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks

### Adding another state to tests

- The problem with expanding the PASS/FAIL mode for tests is that it introduces complexity into the flow AND the unit test frameworks don’t support it (and Ignored tests are as good as non existing tests, since they don’t run)

### On passing tests for bugs/vulns

My view in a way is simple: ‘A Unit Test tests a unit of something in a repeatable and replicable way’ The writer of the test gets to define what that UNIT is, and the location of the test allows all the flexibility to create multiple types of tests 

The binary of the test is just a simple way to say that the UNIT that we are testing (i.e. the Question we are asking) still has the same answer today as it had yesterday.

The reason why bugs and security tests must pass is because we need to know if that issue is still in place after code changes (and if the test fails, it is important to know if it fail because the bug/issue was fixed, or that it is still there, but that to trigger/exploit it has changed)
