**Doing Reviews of Tests Using Printed Out Tests.**

I am a big fan of paper, I am a big fan of printing out things because actually it is much more efficient to consume your information, it is a much more better way to actually read things.

So, a natural progression is we should also be printing out tests. So, if I print out a test I should be able to read the test almost in English and understand what is going on. And review it, and have a firm understanding whether that is important or that isn't important. The test is written and the thing actually prep as well because I have actually found issues where when I review code, and review a test, I find bugs in a test.

So the test should represent the behavior that we are expecting. Printing a test will help to actually understand better that behavior. And in fact it is something that managers, especially technical managers should be doing.
