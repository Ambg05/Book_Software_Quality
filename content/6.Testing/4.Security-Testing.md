## Security testing

### Security review through code steps (in debugging)

### Setting an HTTP Proxy on the the target server

(explain why this technique is so powerful and makes the security testing much more effective)

  - so that we can see the traffic that flows FROM the server into other services
  - very powerful way to find the interdependencies between services
  - very powerful way to understand how much control over the outgoing traffic we have from the outside
    - (add graph that explain this concept)
    - (show example with JVM and apache)

  - also version useful is the sending of these proxy traffic logs to ELK

### JRebel has a development and security tool
