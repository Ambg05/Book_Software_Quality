## Deep coding

### Working from home or in isolation is key for development

It is critical that the developers are able to have periods of 'uninterrupted coding time'.

These are periods of 2h to 4h (if not more), where the developer is able to focus 100% on the task at hand.

Unfortunately most offices environments don't allow this, since there is a constant and regular flow of interruptions which completely destroy the development mojo.

With a good dev and test environment, working from home (or a cafe), can be much more productive, since it should be easier to obtain those uninterrupted periods of coding.

When working alone (or in a small group), what is very important is to be very disciplined with the use of: Email, Web Browsing, Instant Messaging, Twitter, Reddit, etc..

The objective is to get into the zone and just code away.

The ability for a company to trust their developers is also a great measure of a healthy development environment. The reality is that code doesn't lie, and there is a big difference between something who is at home not being productive, and the end result of a nice focused coding session.

Of course that not this isolation will not suit all developer's personalities

### When they start vacuum cleaning around you

- is a good sign


### Ideas are really fragile and need to be captured as soon as possible

- specially since ideas then to feed one another
- and the best idea or concept was not there when the first idea started to be written done
- just like some musicians strategy to write songs, where they start with something they know (another song or pastiche) and start to modify it until something original occurs
