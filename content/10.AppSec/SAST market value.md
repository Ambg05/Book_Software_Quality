_Question - how big would the static analysis market be if it actually worked?_

So here is a question: How big would the static analysis world would be if it actually worked? If we were actually able to look at one app, scan it, and get a really in-depth analysis of what the app does, we could then see what the security side effects are and what needs to be re-mediated.

In fact, one could argue that even if you already had full blown good samples and full blown examples of what should be changed, it still would take awhile to fix.

In another way, though, the question is how big would that market be? And I think it would be enormous, because ultimately once we can do that, we are actually looking business intelligence straight in the eye. And we actually have a massive market in front of us, because theoretically every single app, every iPhone app, every Firefox app, every Windows app, every Shareware app needs to basically go through one of these reviews.
