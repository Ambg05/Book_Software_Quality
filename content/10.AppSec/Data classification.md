### Data classification.

Every type of data that exists in an organization, especially the data that is consumed by applications, needs to have a Data Classification mapping.

Developers need to know if a particular piece of data is sensitive, and what value it holds for the business.

A good way to determine the expected level of confidentiality and integrity, is to ask what would happen _'If a particular set of data were to be fully disclosed?'_ (for example uploaded to PasteBin) or _'If some of the data was being maliciously modified over a period of months?'_.

These are really hard questions, and only by answering, then you can start to understand the value of that particular data set. 

Developers need to understand what they are dealing with, what is valuable to the business, and what needs to be protected.
