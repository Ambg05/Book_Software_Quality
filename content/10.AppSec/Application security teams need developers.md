###  Application security teams need developers

AppSec teams need to have developers under their control, i.e. part of their team, because when we ask dev teams to make changes or implement certain activities like create Threat Models, perform code reviews, validate static analysis findings, build an authorization solution, etcetera, we are giving them work.

Additionally, it is very important that when we do that, we come to the table with resources in hand. The idea is that AppSec needs to have developers that are as good as the developers on the other side of the table.

It is essentially you arriving at the table and saying to the development team, "Hey we need to do this, I am going to throw in a developer X days or a week or a month whatever and you guys need to help".

So in a way this resource is going to help you Mr. Developer to do the XYZ task.

The other thing that's important, is that this gives you the feeling that you can do it regardless of whether the other side will help or not. It gives you the confidence to say, "Hey, I need to do this task. It's part of my agenda, I am doing AppSec and I need to do it, so you can help me or not."

An interesting metric you can provide to the business is to say, "Team A was great and they did all this stuff and we didn't have to really work hard. And Team B didn't do that".

In turn, that is good feedback on the quality, resilience, and focus of the teams.

That being said, it is absolutely critical that the AppSec teams aren't just a kind of TAX or negative force. They need to be positive and say, "Here is the problem we need to address, let's solve it together."
