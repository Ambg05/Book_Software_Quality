### Do you have an AppSec team?

Let's be clear. If part of your InfoSec team you don't have a team of highly skilled professionals who understand AppSec (Application Security), who can program better than most of your developers, and who will be totally hireable by your dev team, then you don't have an AppSec team.

An InfoSec team is also very important to perform this type of work, but if you don't have an AppSec team you simply don't know if your applications are secure or not.

What you want is an AppSec team that is keen to write security code, find vulnerabilities, commit security assessments, review threat models, and work with security champions across the company.

For reference:
- AppSec is about:
  - code, apps, CI, secure coding standards, threat models, frameworks, code dependencies, QA, testing, fuzzing, dev environments, DevOps, ….
- InfoSec is about:
  - Networks, Firewalls, Server security, Anti-virus, IDS, Logging, NOC, Policies, end-user security, mobile devices, AD/Ldap management, user provisioning, DevOps, ….
