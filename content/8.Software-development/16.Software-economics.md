## Software economics

  - (add economics definition and how it applies to software)
  - externalities concept
  - who really pays for quality and security issues
  - "people don't make themselves worse off" [^David-Rice-quote-worse-off]

[^David-Rice-quote-worse-off]: From David Rice's (check exact works and see if this quote if from him) OWASP AppSec California


### How Software is priced

- Doesn't matter how crazy your pricing model is, there is always a customer that will buy it (specially in security, where a large part of the market is driven by FUD)
 - This makes it hard to have a realistic price
- Not a good sign: "No public price" (for example on website)
 - the sales strategy is to try to get as much money from a customer as possible (i.e. answering with "How much money do you have?" or "How much is it worth for you?" to the question "How much does it cost?")
- In a lot of cases what ends up happing is that the customer is 'ripped off' and ends up buying a lot of very expensive 'Shelfware'
- In other markets some might call some software pricing a cartel

### Open Source pricing

- 'No price' is not 'no cost'
- Too many companies use Open Source just because it is 'free' (as in no cost).
 - Microsoft had a a good point when it showed the real cost of Open Source (of course they where bias)
- All software has cost
- As with websites, "If you are not paying, you are the product"
- The real cost of software (namely apps and dependencies) needs to be taken into account
