## Your future self

### Future Self

- protecting your ideas from your future Self
- O2 platform open source Story
- Share knowledge
 - it is not about the ideas it is about the execution
- when you teach you learn more about what you are teaching
- see blog post on this topic
- keep the karma flowing (you learn from others, let others learn from you)
- most of the time it doesn't matter.
- the key is to have a lot of ideas and to find a way to make them work

### Barefoot, evolution and heal-strike

- barefoot story from 'Born to run book'
- real impact in my life (and angles and knees)
- how industry is still not changing
- good example of how good ideas, concepts and solutions don't gain market acceptance.
- I would like to live in a world where most people went barefoot, because it would imply a much more caring world (where people would care about what is thrown to the ground and floor sweepers where highly appreciated)

### Patents

- the issue with Patents
 - we are all sitting on the shoulders of giants
 - all ideas are based on previous ideas
 - patents prevent innovation and product improvements (in today's world)
 - today it is used as a competitive weapon
 - the 'myth of the small inventor'


### Polaroid tragic story

- the polaroid patent wars (with Kodak) and the tragedy of both companies (which spent far too much time fighting the past)

### Twitter has a source of collective intelligence

  - I like to use twitter as a way to capture my knowledge and ideas
  - I want to pay Twitter so that I am the client, not the product
  - due to its status on society, Twitter should be forced to publish their source code
    - there is a lot at stake
    - twitter cannot play the game of 'Security by obscurity'
    - kind of rule change that already happens when companies go public (they have to publish more about what they are doing and what is going on)
  - Twitter is not a valuable service to society, and needs to be view that way
    - It is one of the best sources of real-time information

  - add Story of the company that _'wanted to be on the side of customers')_ (and help it to manage/own their data).
    - I asked the founder to Open Source the code
    - the dev liked it (and understood why without releasing the code, they really couldn't take a Trust position)
    - the founder didn't
    - one of the key issues for me on companies open sourcing or not their code, is 'What is their real agenda?'. When the code is open source, there is a clear statement (and commitment to not locking in users). Note that Open Sourcing code is (usually) easy. The problems tend to be more political or even emotional (usually by devs who want to 'clean up the code')
      - Here is a good question to measure the quality of closed-source code: 'Devs, are you happy for the code to be open sources, or does it need a good clean up?'
        - if the answer is 'it needs to be cleaned up, what does that tell about the code that is currently being sold to customers'
