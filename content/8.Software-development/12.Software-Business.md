## Software Business

### Software Security business model

- How for a lot of companies it doesn't make business sense to write secure code and better at security than their competitors
- Story: Running faster than bears (and what happens with Sharks)
- Story: 'CMS Security review' case study:
   - all apps where bad (large number of security vulns discovered)
   - even after reporting the issues, one of the vendors presentations keep talking about how secure their product was (and how many large customers they had (logos included))
   - Customer picked the 'least worse' (and simpler solution)
   - No product's customers were advised of the issues reported
   - Good example of broken business model, since there is very small business impact for writing insecure code (and apps with lots of vulnerabilities)
   - we should be rewarding good security (with sales and leads)

### Not designed for Security

In lots of cases, an software business model doesn't actually want security, ease of use or even quality (regardless of what the marketing department says)
  - stories about:
      - significant profits are made from support
      - installation complexity is good for business since it requires expensive 'enterprise level install' (the cases when 'Enterprise Software' really means 'Hard to install')
      - proprietary and hard to understand file formats are seen as a competitive advantage (i.e. increase customer 'lock in')
      - APIs and easy ways to access data/functionality is seen as a bad thing (i.e. empowering the customer to solve his problems without the vendor's help)
      - when bugs are sources of profits
      - when next versions have to introduce enough new technology and changes, so that there will be 'more features' (with more bugs and installation requirements)
      - when there is no cost to the vendor for 'locking in' the user
      security is done for compliance (not for protection)

  - Good question to ask (and know) is 'Do you want to be compliant or secure?'


### MDD - Marketing Driven Development

- At the moment there is not way to objectively compare the security of N software products or N websites
 - It's all marketing driven


### Curse of success

  - created by money or users or traffic
  - organic growth is much better
    - with constant acceleration (i.e. refactoring), velocity increases linearly, distance increases (kinda) exponentially (i.e things happen faster and faster)
      - talk exponential growth story "In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?"
  - Microsoft is a great example
    - highly profitable in the 2000s and top of the OS tree
    - but missed the mobile revolution
    - amazing stats that in 2012 after 5 years, the iPhone business was bigger than Microsoft [^iphone-vs-ms]:

## Software business model

- The broken business model of software
- probs of small firms with financing research (unless it is closed)
- Microsoft and Oracle licensing aggressive tactics

- commercial software (and websites) are in the business of locking the users into their technology and products

 - not to solve the user problem
 - but to solve it enough so that it can lock the user in
 - where it is more expensive to leave than to stay (user 'lock in')


### Record Industry business

  - The record business was perfect (for the music industry), they had controlled everything.
  - but lack of innovation and realization they they where about to become a digital business, made this industry really suffer (unfortunately due the harsh business practices against the authors, and very aggressive DRM tactics created a toxic environment between all players).
    -  Sony DRM fiasco (built in backdoor into distributed DRM, which had vulnerabilities)
  - good to study since it is a major industry that has been affected dramatically by software (internet, digital copy, DRM)
