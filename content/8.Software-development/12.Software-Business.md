## Software Business

### Software Security business model

- How for a lot of companies it doesn't make business sense to write secure code and better at security than their competitors
- Story: Running faster than bears (and what happens with Sharks)
- Story: 'CMS Security review' case study:
   - all apps where bad (large number of security vulns discovered)
   - even after reporting the issues, one of the vendors presentations keep talking about how secure their product was (and how many large customers they had (logos included))
   - Customer picked the 'least worse' (and simpler solution)
   - No product's customers were advised of the issues reported
   - Good example of broken business model, since there is very small business impact for writing insecure code (and apps with lots of vulnerabilities)
   - we should be rewarding good security (with sales and leads)

### Not designed for Security

In lots of cases, an software business model doesn't actually want security, ease of use or even quality (regardless of what the marketing department says)
  - stories about:
      - significant profits are made from support
      - installation complexity is good for business since it requires expensive 'enterprise level install' (the cases when 'Enterprise Software' really means 'Hard to install')
      - proprietary and hard to understand file formats are seen as a competitive advantage (i.e. increase customer 'lock in')
      - APIs and easy ways to access data/functionality is seen as a bad thing (i.e. empowering the customer to solve his problems without the vendor's help)
      - when bugs are sources of profits
      - when next versions have to introduce enough new technology and changes, so that there will be 'more features' (with more bugs and installation requirements)
      - when there is no cost to the vendor for 'locking in' the user
      security is done for compliance (not for protection)

  - Good question to ask (and know) is 'Do you want to be compliant or secure?'


### MDD - Marketing Driven Development

- At the moment there is not way to objectively compare the security of N software products or N websites
 - It's all marketing driven


### Curse of success

  - created by money or users or traffic
  - organic growth is much better
    - with constant acceleration (i.e. refactoring), velocity increases linearly, distance increases (kinda) exponentially (i.e things happen faster and faster)
      - talk exponential growth story "In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?"
  - Microsoft is a great example
    - highly profitable in the 2000s and top of the OS tree
    - but missed the mobile revolution
    - amazing stats that in 2012 after 5 years, the iPhone business was bigger than Microsoft [^iphone-vs-ms]:

## Software business model

- The broken business model of software
- probs of small firms with financing research (unless it is closed)
- Microsoft and Oracle licensing aggressive tactics

- commercial software (and websites) are in the business of locking the users into their technology and products

 - not to solve the user problem
 - but to solve it enough so that it can lock the user in
 - where it is more expensive to leave than to stay (user 'lock in')


### Record Industry business

  - The record business was perfect (for the music industry), they had controlled everything.
  - but lack of innovation and realization they they where about to become a digital business, made this industry really suffer (unfortunately due the harsh business practices against the authors, and very aggressive DRM tactics created a toxic environment between all players).
    -  Sony DRM fiasco (built in backdoor into distributed DRM, which had vulnerabilities)
  - good to study since it is a major industry that has been affected dramatically by software (internet, digital copy, DRM)


### Outsourcing code development

When you outsource code development, you must have total control over what they are doing.

 This means that you need to have access to :
  - the source code (all of it, including graphic source files),
  - the build files
  - the build environments,
  - QA, Pre-prod and prod environments,

You need to replicate, in-house, exactly what they are doing.

The reason you are outsourcing is because they can do a particular project cheaper, faster and more efficiently that you can do in-house.

What you shouldn’t outsource is you’re ability to understand the application and your ability to monitor what they (the outsourcer) are doing.

The outsourcing company is in a business of making you pay for their work.

Yes, they need to deliver what they committed to, but you can have sometimes very twisted models where the outsourcing partner knows that you are locked in, so they just do 'good enough work', not best in class (which is what you want to have, when you are the outsourcing party).

You need to make sure that you:

  - know who they really are,
  - need to interview the people that is working on your application's,
  - need to handpick the people from the company that you are hiring, because ultimately you don’t outsource to a company, you outsource to individuals that work for that company.
    - it matters the people that they put on your side,
    - it matters if they have training,
    - it matters if they are good enough

All this is something that you need to manage from your side of things.

How can you measure and control them?

One of the key messages of this book is that can use Application Security as a way to control and manage the outsourcing parties.

*Why Application Security?*

because it asks very specific questions which are very pragmatic and very objective.

And once you have live exploits, you have evidence on what happens is really happening.

One of the things I remember when I was doing pentest(s) to code written by outsourcing companies, is how very explicit and very defensible your findings have to be.

For me that is all about being able to prove what happened, and what its the consequences.  

I remember thinking that I was in the business of providing 'Highly defensible findings, where one mistake in a medium issue could jeopardize the integrity of the whole report (or test scripts)'
