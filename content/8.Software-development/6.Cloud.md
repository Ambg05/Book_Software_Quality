### Which AWS region is holding your data

  - Simple question, which requires a lot of maturity and understanding to answer
  - Very relevant with latest data privacy laws and requirements
  - Who has access to data (like user's PII) depends on where physically the servers are located (which is an interesting concept in a cloud world)
