## Legacy code

  - Legacy code tends to be code that by definition is:
     - Not very well understood
     - hard to make changes
     - hard to understand the sides effects of changes

  - all above reasons are why tests are so important and cost effective

  - how to handle legacy app is key for the health and quality of code
  - apps developed today will become tomorrow legacy apps
  - story of how even on new 'green field' (multi-year development), the same problems started to occur: "can't do this XYZ quality action because we have a major deadline in XYZ weeks and don't have time"
  - use bugs (or feature requests) as assets (and opportunities to improve testing infrastructure)
  - fix bugs as fire-drills
  - the false economy of 'just fix the code'



### The more complex the code more tests are needed

  - the less understood the code the more tests are needed
  - this is specially important for legacy code
    - the false economy of thinking that legacy code doesn't need tests and should only be patched
    - legacy code is 'live code' and will need to be modified regularly
    - retrofitting tests into an app, should be an core skill and capability of a company

### Adding CI to legacy apps is a high-priority task

  - adding continuous integration to legacy apps should be an core skill and capability
  - if an app is hard to deploy, every small change will be a pain. Which is specially problematic for security fixes and security incidents
  - false economy of not adding CI since over a period (6 months, 1 year), the cost (on time, development and hard deployments) spent on 'urgent' fixes is more than the cost of building an CI
    - and the is CI is hard to build, that is pollution and sign that there are major problems with the current infrastructure / setup
  - there is also the missed opportunity cost, where requested business changes do not occur at a decent/acceptable speed.
    - this is made worse, by the fact that legacy apps are usually the ones making money for the company (i.e. the ones actually adding business value)


### Legacy apps

  - really bad concept
  - all code will become legacy
  - don't call it legacy, call it live (specially when the legacy code is making the money)
  - keep improving and refactoring legacy code (as in a 'replace in context' change). Keep improving it, and making it better.
    - this approach is more cost effective than 'just maintaining it' and dealing with what is wrong (by depressed and non-motivated developers)
    - make it so that there is a fair competing level-playing field between the 'legacy' and the new stuff (which needs to be significantly better)
    - lack of doing this is why a large number of IT/software projects fail

### New Devs should write Tests

  - Newly joined Devs should spend a couple weeks just writing tests
      - even if they will eventually work on newer parts of the application (i.e. the non-legacy part of the app)
  - Great way to learn the app

### Make business owners 'own' the 'lack of understandability'

  - a way to make it expensive to have legacy apps that are hard to understand, is to expose the level of understanding & coverage
  - business owners need to accept (and buy) the Risk
    - every bug or incident that occurs on that app is added to the 'total cost of current status'

### Have strategy to 'un-legacy legacy apps'

  - map what will be needed to that
  - continuous evolution path, where small changes are made in a continuous way, so that the app is less and less 'legacy' with every change
  - understand what makes the app 'legacy' (i.e. what is the definition of legacy code/app'
    - it might be surprising to find that code written the week before (or apps developed in the last 6 months) already fit this definition of 'legacy apps'

### Case study: Adding Tests for inherited WebService

  - very good way to understand how Web Service behaved
  - therapeutic experience for developers (since it was a step-by-step way to learn the Web Service's capabilities and behavior)
  - quick identify which methods are not needed any more and can be removed (i.e. remove non-relevant code)  

### Case study: When the DB was refactored for in-memory DB

  - with file base persistence
  - massive performance increase
