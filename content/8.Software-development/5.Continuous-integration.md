## Continuous integration

### Continuous integration vs Continuous deployment

- differences between them
- CD should be a business decision
- workflow where code is deployed to live servers that are only available locally
- how docker/containers helps to make this happen
- the security issue of having QA and pre-prod running with live data (which over exposes that data)

### The travis workflow

- trigged on community
- rebuilds all dependencies
- runs all Tests
- badges
- creates artifacts
- triggers next steps

- supports both headless and desktop/browser based tests

### BgDD: Badge-Driven-Development

- rewards work
- show examples of travis, coveralls, npm badges

### Pristine build servers

- why they are important
- control dependencies
- build core images
- protect build servers (with no direct access by devs)
- run on docker
- use git hashes to monitor and detect abuses

### deploy using git

- new deployments as git pushes or pulls
- confirm deployments using git hashes
  - git commits are a hash with the current change and the entire history
- Linus 'security hash' story
