## Continuous integration

### Continuous integration vs Continuous deployment

- differences between them
- CD should be a business decision
- workflow where code is deployed to live servers that are only available locally
- how docker/containers helps to make this happen
- the security issue of having QA and pre-prod running with live data (which over exposes that data)

### The travis workflow

- trigged on community
- rebuilds all dependencies
- runs all Tests
- badges
- creates artifacts
- triggers next steps

- supports both headless and desktop/browser based tests

### BgDD: Badge-Driven-Development

- rewards work
- show examples of travis, coveralls, npm badges
- see

### Pristine build servers

- why they are important
- control dependencies
- build core images
- protect build servers (with no direct access by devs)
- run on docker
- use git hashes to monitor and detect abuses

### deploy using git

- new deployments as git pushes or pulls
- confirm deployments using git hashes
  - git commits are a hash with the current change and the entire history
- Linus 'security hash' story

### API Synchronization

- keeping APIs in sync is a major issue in large teams
- prob of API Freeze, caused my most powerful team
 - if the most powerful team is the one making the APIs, then all consumers will be affected
 - if the most powerful team is one of the consumers, then they will pressure the API team to not release often

### Release and maintain your own API clients

  - API teams should provide clients for their APIs

### Many API teams have no idea who their real clients

  - who really consumes their endpoints
  - who consumes the consumers
  - security visualization answers these questions

### Story: the API that started read-only and ending with RCE


### Release coordination

- key challenge when teams are releasing ofter is how to keep the releases coordinated (so that the entire system's speed is not determined by the slowest team)
- ability to simulate each dependencies and be able to easily switch between versions is key to make this a smooth process
- git submodules is a great solution for this problem

### Release speed is a great metric

- faster the releases the more refactoring can occur
- but how to do security at speed?
