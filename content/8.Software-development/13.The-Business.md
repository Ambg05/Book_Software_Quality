## The 'Business'

  - The company that is creating the software

### When Quality intersects with the 'Business'  

  - the 'house is on fire' issues are easy to solve, the prob are the other issues (which fall into the 'non functional requirements' backlog pile)
  - This big challenge is what happens when the next set of quality (or security) changes cannot be done without a change in how the business works (or it's management or strategy)
  - Using the factory analogy and pollution
    - there is a moment when reducing pollution cannot be done without changes how the factory actually works and its setup
    - this can create perverse incentives (when companies not really want to understand the root cause of an issue)
