## Software Evolution

### Code evolution

- code as an evolving organism
 - even has a living thing
- what code wants? [^wtw]

[^wtw]: Similar question to the one asked by the 'What Technology Wants' book (Kevin Kelly)

### Code as information system

- Information system is based on two properties
 - What is remembered
 - What is forgotten

- Money is an information system [^wotf-28]
- Information technology: "Design Judgments about what to remember and what to forget"

- What is lost when coding is key to understand the code (and the original problem that was being solved) [^bret-ibm]

[^wotf-28]: 'Who owns the future', p28
[^bret-ibm]: See Bret Victor's IBM presentation (view of the future from the past), namely on code representations ideas at the time (and how little we have progressed)

- Measure code quality not by what is there, but by what is missing.
 - the most important parts of music are silence and dynamics (i.e. the intervals between the notes).
 - the most important notes are the notes not played

- Code as an information system is also a good function to make connections with human behavior analysis like the one shown in the 'Predictably Irrational' book.

### Codelens and LightTable

- Developer's immediate connection to what they are creation
- Bret Victor "Inventing on principle" [^bret]

### Code wars

- when algorithms fight

I> see book with code algorithms story (from stock market to music)
