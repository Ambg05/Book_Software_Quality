## Defending from Attacks

### Security model based on attackers making mistakes

  - Defending everything all the time doesn't scale
  - all attackers make mistakes
    - add Stuxnet story
  - exploratory workflow (where exploits are tested before executed)

### Making attacker's life harder

  - attackers want reliable exploits
  - difficult the sale of compromised assets
  - for each phase of the attack, custom the 'defense' technique:
    - reconnaissance
    - exploit
    - persistence
    - clean-up
  - each phase requires different assets and touch different parts of the infrastructure (which need to reliable and deterministic, in order to make the exploit robust)
  - understand how the attackers work and make it difficult to get reliable exploit execution (require component to sell access)
  - limit value of compromised data, but sending corrupted data to attackers
  
  -  "You can't defend something you don't understand", "We make it so that we know more about your network than you do" (get exact quotes from [^tao])
