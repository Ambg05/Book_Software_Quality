## Code Coverage

### How Code Coverage works

  - (explain using NodeJs) - easier to visualise
  - (explain using Java's code introspection [^java-cc])

### Advanced uses of Code Coverage

  - detect attack surface changes
  - debug code
  - see code execution (with running the app), sometimes in real-time
  - app behavior tests
  - event replication
  - multiple threads testing
  - optimize code
  - call's count

### FluentSharp and FluentNode

  - expanding test api's capabilities and functionality
    - run IE with integration test in an hidden window
    - use .NET's MarshalByRefObject to test back end objects running on real rest service
  - making it easier to read tests
    - (add examples)
