## AppSec

### AppSec as Transformation agents

### Secure Continuous Delivery

### Delivering PDFs as pentest reports

- broken model

### AppSec needs to understand how it works

- during normal development the need to understand how it works is not fully understood
- it is important that devs have time to really dig deep into the frameworks that are using

### Application Security as source of truth

  - based on facts and reality
  - created by daily operations
  - maintained by Threat models
  - why is it that the AppSec is the only one that knows what exists and where everything is (from websites to code libraries)
  - you can protect something you don't know about
  - you can't secure what you can't measure

### Making the business case for AppSec

#### that AppSec makes it more efficient

#### that AppSec can be used to tackle the legacy code issue


### AppSec reviews are very hard

  -  when doing an security review of an application the security professional needs to (in one or two weeks)
    - understand an application that was developed for years and has tons of moving parts
    - test the application
    - find the security issues
    - create PoCs (Proof of Concept) to prove that they exist (also called exploits)
    - document those issues
    - complete report with guidance for issues discovered
  - in practice it means the development of great techniques to quickly (and effectively) understand (and learn) new architectures, and 'HOW' things really work
  - high proficiency in code reading is also highly important

### How to commission and run AppSec reviews

#### What is wrong with current pentests

- Don't pay somebody do show you how good they are
- Tilt the odds in favor of the test
- objective is to raise the level of security and find blind spots

### AppSec is the business of providing highly defensible findings

 - findings are heavily scrutinized and any mistake will cast an heavy shadow (and doubt) on the report
 - receiving end doesn't usually want to believe on the findings
 - beware of the elephant in the room: 'who is paying for the fix?'

### EDD: Evidence Driven Development

- have data to support arguments
- AppSec allows to comment on architecture by commenting on the risk implications
  - add story: Multi-Tenant vs Single-Tenant architecture
    - from a security point of view
    - ... dropping the user at the gate

### 100% SSL in Europe/US

 - is that possible?
 - is SSL/TLS the best solution (see moxie idea for an solution for the SSL CA problem: Convergence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(SSL)
 - we need better solutions encryption solutions
 - SSL not only gives us confidentiality, but it gives us integrity too (which is really needed)
 - Do we need to encrypt everything? What about just sign it?
 - What are the problems with SSL Everywhere
  - "Web Security - "HTTPS Everywhere" harmful", by Tim Berners-Lee  https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Security-NotTheS.html



### what to call AppSec or security professionals

- for example when making references together with developers: "Developers and AppSec professionals" seems to imply that Developers are not professionals
- what about using the term 'AppSec Developers' since that imply that type of professional that is both an Developer and AppSec specialist
