## Good news

We still use the web

We still shop online....

It has not collapsed... (yet)

Making progress

- Operating Systems are getting better
- Some companies get it (some industries more than others)
- It is possible to write secure code
- The general awareness is Growing
- When companies care (or are forced to) they do a much better job
- Some clients are starting to demand more secure products applications
- Some Frameworks are able to hide security from developers and make
created app ‘not vulnerable' by default
- OWASP Is working on solutions :)

But, the problem is

Not enough skilled attackers (with evolved business models) which would
build the business case to do something about it
- Most clients/developers don't care (unless they have been attacked or have a
key individual that ‘forces' security)
- Writing secure code is:
- hard
- expensive
- time consuming
- not scalable
- not appreciated by the business (& paying customer)
- not user friendly
