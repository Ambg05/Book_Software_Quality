## Why am I so worried?

- There is no urgency today that we should be tacking this problem
- If we have to solve this problem after a major security incident we will be much worse of (see what happened in America after 9/11 with the massive over reaction that happened there)
- because I want to solve the web application security problem before it gets too serious
- the real problem with cyber security and malicious attacks are organised crime (i.e. criminals that are focused on making money who have the: intent, funding, technical ability, profit-focus and no ethical boundaries)
- Today some of the best distributed networks in the world are maintained by criminals groups (the botnets)
- When was the last time you saw a commercial solution that is able to successful maintain a network of millions of computers?

- One day these criminals, if they get big enough, will realize that the biggest threat to their business model is us, the security focused people (i.e. the people in this room)
- That day they will be motivated to put a bullet in our heads, or just blow up (or poison the coffee) at one of our conferences!
- Question: what would happen if all of us DIED now? What do you think would be security impact on your company’s Security profile?
- If I wanted to attack you company/sector, wouldn’t it make sense to kill you first? (since you would be the ones tried to detect and stop the attack?
