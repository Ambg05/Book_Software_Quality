# Group Think

_"Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints, by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences."_ (wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink]

Basically....
 ....‘Group Think' is when most ‘players'
	 	 ... say/think that that the
	 	 	 	 	 	 ... current status is correct

... which is usually false

... a variation of ‘group think' is when
 ....we say YES
 ... due to ‘market/peer' pressure             


Here are some examples of

... recent ‘group-thinks' ... it would be great if we ...could learn from the past

  - Enron
  - Madoff
  - ‘Markets are efficient'             
  - Lehman Brothers
  - WMD


.... so what is Application Security ‘group think'

  - There is nothing majorly wrong with: 'The state of Application security world'
  - ... Nothing has happened (so far) ... There has been no major disruption (so far)

but...
apps (including ‘security products') have ...
   massive vulnerabilities ...
     and (most) vendors and clients ...
	 	 	 are not motivated/interested in fixing them ...
	 	 	 	 	 	 (until there is an attack)

Unfortunately ...
 ... Strong NDAs & no Disclosure Laws ...
 	 	 (prevent current knowledge ...
 	 	 	 	 from being known)             

So we don't reward who does it right....

... and invests in security ...
But wont disclosure of information make it more dangerous? ...
 	 	 won't the the attackers benefit ...
 	 	 	 	 from knowing this information? ...        


 ... don't worry ...
 	 	 	 	 	 .... they already have that information
