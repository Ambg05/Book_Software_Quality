## The truth is out there

Surely, right?

Current state of disclosure laws: We can't speak about problems we know!!!

If we know that the main government XYZ website
has massive vulnerabilities and could be malicious
exploited (or even that is currently being exploited)
we cannot talk about it

“...I wish I could talk about the security
vulnerabilities in medical systems that I am
aware of since if they are exploited they could
have serious implications for people's lives...”
security consultant (in AppSec conference) who can't  put his name to this phase

Today we promote complacency and reward the inaction. Good thing that there are not enough malicious attackers

Why does government(s) accepts to be controlled by 3rd party companies and governments (who control the software we run)

**We all have the head in the sand**

Nothing to do with us...

This is like knowing about the state of the financial industry (Banks, Madoff, Lehman Brothers) before the crash and not doing anything about it
