### OWASP Challenges World Governments to Improve Application Security

(from OWASP IBWAS conference in Madrid)

_"Through the passionate discussion held in the "Web Application Security: What should Governments do in 2010?" panel, several conclusions have been reached._


_These conclusions reflect the decisions made by the panel and are meant to be debated, updated and eventually published by OWASP as a set of recommendations._


_Panelâ€™s conclusions:_

_1. We challenge governments to work with OWASP to increase the transparency of web application security, particularly with respect to financial, health and all other systems where data privacy and confidentiality requirements are fundamental;_
_2. OWASP will seek participation with governments around the globe to develop recommendations for the incorporation of specific application security requirements and the development of suitable certification frameworks within the government software acquisition processes;_
_3. We offer our assistance to clarify and modernize computer security laws, allowing the Government, citizens and organizations to make informed decisions about security;_
_4. We ask governments to encourage companies to adopt application security standards that, where followed, will help protect us all from security breaches, which might expose confidential information, enable fraudulent transactions and incur legal liability;_
_5.We offer to work with local and national governments to establish application security dashboards providing visibility into spending and support for application security._
