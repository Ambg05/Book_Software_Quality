## DevOps

DevOps is key for quality and security

### When moving to the cloud, Devs are becoming SysAdmins

- which is a an issue

### Don't kill the Ops
- be careful that DevOps is not a cost saving exercise, where it is seen as a way to kill/reduce Ops.
 - Dev + Ops -> DevOps -> Dev

### Infrastructure as code (all changes are code, and all changes need tests)


### Patch status as a metric of quality

  - patching shouldn't be a problem
    - if it is a problem:
      - then that needs to addressed
      - means that there are probs in deploying the app (or rebuilding the server)
      - means hard rollbacks
    - open JIRA ticket on 'lack of patching'
      - do this before an incident, so that when probs occur (due to lack of patching), there is a way to capture the incidents
      - history (and murphey) should provide evidence on the cost of non-patching
  - lack of patching are 'canaries on coal mine' (point to a bigger problem)
  - think of patching as 'fire drills'

#### Patching is easy

 When:
  - it is easy to run the new version in an isolated environment (with and without production data)
    - there is a good understanding of what is going to change (files, ports, behavior, inter-dependencies, schema's changes)
      - i.e. a diff with the current version of everything
  - there are Tests (e2e and integration) that run though the affected systems success criteria and confirm (if any) what changed (i.e. the side effects)
  - it easy to rollback to previous version(s)

### Performing root-cause analysis

  - some environments make it hard to perform root-cause analysis, because it is seen as a blame exercise, instead of a learning opportunity
  - Root-cause analysis are key for any bug (namely one the ones with Security implications)
    - lack of 'Root-cause analysis' is a risk (which needs to be accepted)
      - means business owners doesn't want to spend the time to find other (similar issues)
  - add story of project manager that asked "please don't find more security issues during the retest (they are out of scope)"
