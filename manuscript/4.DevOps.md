## DevOps

DevOps is key for quality and security

### When moving to the cloud, Devs are becoming SysAdmins

- which is a an issue

### Don't kill the Ops
- be careful that DevOps is not a cost saving exercise, where it is seen as a way to kill/reduce Ops.
 - Dev + Ops -> DevOps -> Dev

### Infrastructure as code (all changes are code, and all changes need tests)
