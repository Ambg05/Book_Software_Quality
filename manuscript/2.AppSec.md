## AppSec

### AppSec as Transformation agents

### Secure Continuous Delivery

### Delivering PDFs as pentest reports

- broken model

### AppSec needs to understand how it works

- during normal development the need to understand how it works is not fully understood
- it is important that devs have time to really dig deep into the frameworks that are using

### Application Security as source of truth

  - based on facts and reality
  - created by daily operations
  - maintained by Threat models
  - why is it that the AppSec is the only one that knows what exists and where everything is (from websites to code libraries)
  - you can protect something you don't know about
  - you can't secure what you can't measure

### Making the business case for AppSec

#### that AppSec makes it more efficient

#### that AppSec can be used to tackle the legacy code issue


### AppSec reviews are very hard

  -  when doing an security review of an application the security professional needs to (in one or two weeks)
    - understand an application that was developed for years and has tons of moving parts
    - test the application
    - find the security issues
    - create PoCs (Proof of Concept) to prove that they exist (also called exploits)
    - document those issues
    - complete report with guidance for issues discovered
  - in practice it means the development of great techniques to quickly (and effectively) understand (and learn) new architectures, and 'HOW' things really work
  - high proficiency in code reading is also highly important

### How to commission and run AppSec reviews

#### What is wrong with current pentests

- Don't pay somebody do show you how good they are
- Tilt the odds in favor of the test
- objective is to raise the level of security and find blind spots
