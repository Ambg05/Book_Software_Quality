## Health and Safety

We expect water, restaurants,cars, planes, food,drink, medicaments, chairs, tables, roofs to have a minimum level of quality
We have laws that regulate them
We have laws that mandate disclosure of known problems

But, we have very little (if anything) in software and web applications
(PCI / DSS is an rare example)

Software and Web Application licenses gives
 the client no rights
	 	 	 (he clicked on the EULA)
	 	 	 and gives the vendor no
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 liability and responsibility


We know disclosure works (public 0-days get patched quickly)               


Non disclosure of application security information does not make us more secure, it just promotes complacency

The risk of a attack driven by the disclosure of the information is offset by the improvement of security

And any malicious attacker will have access to that information

In fact most malicious attackers today care more about your system than you (and in fact in a lot of cases they will protect and maintain the systems they compromise (its bad for their business to have other malicious attackers also compromising those boxes))
