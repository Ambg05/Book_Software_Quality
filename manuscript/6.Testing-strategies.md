## Testing Strategies

### Given, When, Then

### Tests as wind tunnels

  - we need tests that exist like 'wind tunnels' for cars
  - standard tests as ways to formalize the behavior of software components.
    - just like what happens in the other sciences (chemistry, physics)

### is software a science?

  - see what is the current definition of science and see if software fits into it

### Measuring software understanding

  - we need to measure how much we understand a piece of code
    - sometimes the answer should be "we just don't know", "There is too much complexity and that is not possible to predict the behavior and execution flow of this code"

  - users (and buyers) have the right to know how much the software/code that controls their lives is really understood.
    - software needs to be maintained (complexity and lack of understanding needs to be expensive)
    - what happens when key developers or architects leave (and take with them key knowledge about a particular application)
    - using 3rd party components is no excuse to not understand it (or demand that it's makers still support it)
    - we should have a healthy network of companies that provide support, maintenance and assurance for 3rd party code
      - related to concept of requiring companies to release end-of-life software as open source
        - for example windows xp [^xp-foss]
        - so that others can maintain it

  - always shocking for professionals from mature industries (like layers, house architects, doctors, beer plant manager) to understand how immature, crazy and lack of standards the software world is

  - story of the screw and how it changes the industry

[^xp-foss]: Microsoft should had force their next generation os developers (Vista, 7, 9 and 10) to compete with XP (allowing XP to compete independently). The new OS developers were given millions of new users for they new product just by releasing it (which always happened late and with tons of new bugs)


### users control over their data

  - users need to be able to control their data
  - have access to all of it
  - not just a curated version of it
  - but all that exists (including in raw format)
  - allow 3rd parties to consume it
  - allow 3rd parties to encrypt it and release it on demand
  - this is one area were regulation would make a big difference (just like when supermarkets or makers are responsible for recycling - suddenly they care a lot more about the packaging of products and how their raw materials can be reused)
  - there are lots of interesting business opportunities in creating companies to manage user data, when the user is the client (not the product)
     - user can get nano payments for their data usage
     - if the user's data was used to recommend a product to another user, why wasn't the original user rewarded (for example on amazon book recommendations, or book reviews).
     - this service could be provided by an collaborative commons entity (or even the government)
      - although we live in a weird era where it is the private sector that is pushing for privacy, where that was supposed to be the government's job
