## Security past vulns (examples)

### Open SSL bug (Heartbleed)

- Example of Open Source failure at the many eyeballs concept
- Response shows the power of Open Source

### Facebook CSRF on image (deployed via logout link)

### MySpace XSS worm

### .NET Parser vuln

- vuln I reported to MSRC which was done via fuzzing

### Voice social engineering

(from VH Video)

- Crying baby attack
- List how she did it and what she was able to do (data retrieved and password set)

### Install malware from email

(from VH Video)

- using fake support email
- install app to get next set of pwds
- capture camera
- make connection to devs laptops

### Drones attack Drones

- Sammy example of how he used a Drone to attack another drone and gain control of them (by pretending to be an base station and exploiting an authorization vuln)

### Power supply worm (smart grid)

- IOActive exploit

### CardIDs exploit

- IOActive research (see if all details were published)

### Hacking cars

- case where car was remotely controlled
- example of industry fail
- Troy Hunt example
- FBI alert on car security
 - how crazy some of the recommendations are (when viewed from a current 'car security' point of view)
 - how normal the same recommendations are (when viewed from a 'current software expectations' point of view)

### Timing attacks

- Oracle padding attacks
 - explain how they worked
- Pixel attacks
 - side channels attacks on minor timing issues on browsers graphs rendering functions
 - explain how attack was optimized using statistical analysis of source code ascii chars

### Wifi

 - T.J.Max : _'hackers cracked the WEP encryption protocol used to transmit data between price-checking devices, cash registers and computers at a store in Minnesota. The intruders then collected information submitted by employees logging on to the company's central database in Massachusetts, stealing usernames and passwords. With that information, the hackers set up their own accounts on TJX's system. Over the 18-month period, their software collected transaction data, including credit-card numbers, into approximately 100 large files.'_  [^tjmax]

## NSA tools

- (Pick couple examples from Snowden leaked docs)

## Bug bounties

- use bug bounties for examples of vulns (for example all of OWASP Top 10)
- these are more realistic examples of vulns (since they are real world) and the dollar value paid also shows how valuable they are to the affected companies

### Bug bounty examples

- Facebook account pwd reset via lack of automation protection on beta server
- Google XXE on Icon XML
- Github RCE on Site pages
