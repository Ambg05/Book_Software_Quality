## Your future self

### Future Self

- protecting your ideas from your future Self
- O2 platform open source Story
- Share knowledge
 - it is not about the ideas it is about the execution
- when you teach you learn more about what you are teaching
- see blog post on this topic
- keep the karma flowing (you learn from others, let others learn from you)
- most of the time it doesn't matter.
- the key is to have a lot of ideas and to find a way to make them work

### Barefoot, evolution and heal-strike

- barefoot story from 'Born to run book'
- real impact in my life (and angles and knees)
- how industry is still not changing
- good example of how good ideas, concepts and solutions don't gain market acceptance.
- I would like to live in a world where most people went barefoot, because it would imply a much more caring world (where people would care about what is thrown to the ground and floor sweepers where highly appreciated)

### Patents

- the issue with Patents
 - we are all sitting on the shoulders of giants
 - all ideas are based on previous ideas
 - patents prevent innovation and product improvements (in today's world)
 - today it is used as a competitive weapon
 - the 'myth of the small inventor'


### Polaroid tragic story

- the polaroid patent wars (with Kodak) and the tragedy of both companies
