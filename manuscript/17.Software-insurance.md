## Software insurance

 - insurance industry have business requirement to have good data and metrics. They would price their premiums based on apps security
  - supported by 'science'. In food we have: labels, standards, food-chain controls, liability, insurance, etc...But in software?

  - "the answer to insecure software is civil prosecution & awareness by insurance companies" [^@starbuck3000-insurance]

### 'Anti-Lock-In' insurance

  - Users/customers should be able to buy *'Anti-Lock-In'* insurance policies

    - cover the costs of moving a particular software/application (and its data) into another competitor's platform]
    - This would be an effective way to measure how 'locked in' an user, company or country, intelligence-service actually is.
    - We could create the *'Lock-in Index'* which maps the 'lock-in cost' (and insurance premiums)
    - this can be done by starting small, figuring it out, defining the metrics and then letting it grow exponentially until it reaches critical mass
      - for this to work, the clients (i.e. the ones paying for software) really need to take this serious and push for it)

  - 'how locked in' are you?
  - 'locked in' also applies to FOSS


### who is a client and how are they paying for software

 - you can pay with money, but also with time, attention, eyeballs,  clicks or data

### why the clients need to come together

- the clients (ie. the users) of software need to come together and use their combined purchasing power to change the market dynamics
- problem that Union have such a bad reputation and allergy (since an Union is just a group that represents its members).

### learning from the past

  - Software past failures should be able to provide good data to measure the 'lock in' index
  - For example ERP failures [^erp-disasters]
    - (I remember a quote/stats about how many companies that implemented SAP went bust or had serious problems)
