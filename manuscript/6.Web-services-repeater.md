### Web Services Repeater

What I'm trying to show here (not my best drawing) is a special type of test environment which allows the replay of content from a dependent web service

  - the A box is a website
  - the WS box is a Web Service
  - the Green box has two parts
    - T : Integration tests execution which invoke the WS (this data is saved as JSON, which is what the 3 rectangles to the left of the green box represent)
    - RS : Replay Service (which replays the JSON back to A)
  - the red circles inside the 3 rectangles) represent security tests injected inside the JSON content that is feed back to the A website
