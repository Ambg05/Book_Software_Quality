## Measuring Software Quality using Application Security

Software Craftsmanship is about Software Quality

a big problem with the Craftsmanship (and testing) community is:  ‘How to define Quality?’

Everybody knows that Quality is key … but … ‘how to measure Quality?’

My thesis is that Application Security can be used to  define and measure Quality

Application Security is all about the non-functional requirements of software (software = apps, websites, web services, apis, tools, build scripts = code)

Application Security is all about understanding  HOW the software works

Using Application Security  I can measure the quality of software

Because Application Security  measures the unintended side effects of coding
