## Software Business

### Not designed for Security

  The normal business model does not want security. They reward
    - Ease of use, quality (find list where security comes last)


### Curse of success

  - created by money or users or traffic
  - organic growth is much better
    - with constant acceleration (i.e. refactoring), velocity increases linearly, distance increases (kinda) exponentially (i.e things happen faster and faster)
      - talk exponential growth story "In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?"
  - Microsoft is a great example
    - highly profitable in the 2000s and top of the OS tree
    - but missed the mobile revolution
    - amazing stats that in 2012 after 5 years, the iPhone business was bigger than Microsoft [^iphone-vs-ms]:
