## The zone

### The Zone in music

- this was where I really started to experience it and realized that it is both a mental and physical experience
- Everything becomes clear and easy
- What great bass players have
- Success is 99% perspiration and 1% talent (John Gilbey (confirm))

#### Why music and programming are so similar

- attract similar crowds
- lots of programmers (and security professionals) also code
- music learning also has a lot of deep work (and undivided attention/focus)
- OWASP Band case study
 - "SQL Injection blues" :)

### Rubik's cube

- Great practice
- Not that hard to solve (once the core sequence and algorithms are learned)
- Interesting part is to really understand what is going on
- Good to focus

### Taking notes by hand is better

An interesting research (find reference) found that students that take notes using a physical notebook have better comprehension than students that take notes using laptops.

This can be related to the fact that we can type without looking at the keyboard (so there are less senses involved and less connections made in the brain)

Same problems occur when we receive navigation instructions when driving (versus learning the path and creating references along the way)

- it could be that when we do this 'half-focused' tasks, we do the WHAT, but not the WHY or HOW
- writing creates a better hyperlinked result
- when we write we have to look at the page that we are writing into

### Coding by hand

This chain of thought actually takes us to an interesting question which is: 'Are the situations where we should Code on Pen and Paper?'

- cases where syntax doesn't matter (or can be easily corrected)
- cases where the focus is on quality, structure, form?
- coding by hand is what we do when we start drawing diagrams on white boards

### Code fast and slow

  - work in 2h to 8h blocs [^hut8labs]
  - see 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' book (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576) and http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2015/04/security-fast-and-security-slow.html

### Shadow of an idea

- When you can't remember the exact idea that you had, just that you had the idea.
  - This is quite frustrating since we remember the emotions of the idea (was it funny, tragic, serious) and even the shape  of it (for example: 'it had 4 letters')
  - this happened to me a couple times when I was taking notes down (in my analog notebook) for this book. I also had it when I was writing on the laptop, and found it worse
    - i.e. I would lose those ideas more often when in the laptop, versus when in the notebook (which I why I preferred to use paper vs digital to capture my ideas)

### spellchecking has an mental-model-breaker

- An interesting problem that occurs when writing on the laptop are the regular interruptions, caused by the spellchecker and by syntactical mistakes.
  - This breaks the flow of what we are writing
  - In a way, the fact that when we are writing in digital format we can do it in a final state, makes it more distracting. When one is writing on paper, I find that the ideas flow better, and more importantly are easily hyperlinked

### printing to review what is on the screen

A good example of the power of paper is the practice of printing a document (or book chapter) for review. What is amazing is how often this finds issues and problems there were simply not visible on the screen
  - {Link to 'How many Fs can use see' question}

### Record business

- The record business was perfect (for the music industry), they had controlled everything.
 - but lack of innovation and realization they they where about to become a digital business, made this industry really suffer (unfortunately due the harsh business practices against the authors, and very aggressive DRM tactics created a toxic environment between all players).
  - Sony DRM fiasco (built in backdoor into distributed DRM, which had vulnerabilities)
